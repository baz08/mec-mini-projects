Ghosts &amp; Goblins made you play through the game twice in order to win it. 

Ikari Warriors was an unbalanced difficulty. The nerd called attention to the fact that in the game your bullets only travel a certain distance, but the enemies can shoot at you from across a full screen. 

And in Battletoads, you can hit your teammate in 2-player mode, and if one of you loses your last life, both of you start the stage over again.

Here's the thing though.  Bogut was more impactful defensively than Draymond in the first half of that series.  He was blocking and altering tons of shots.  He was the reason that LeBron and Kyrie were having trouble penetrating and finishing inside.  NOT Dray.

Kerr knew this, and also knew that he had to keep Bogut on the floor even though Bogut was injury prone, and that injury was inevitable.  The Warriors announcers even talked about his work load a couple of times leading up to the injury.

Additionally, Draymond's suspension was not from a single incident.  He had been making questionable and downright dirty plays for the entire series.  Had he not been playing so dirty, the Cavs wouldn't have been down 3-1 to begin with.",/r/clevelandcavs/comments/sgcfmx/does_draymond_green_regret_retaliating_against/huvx4rr/
huvx622,Joking_909,2022-01-30 10:56:47,"**Meta Knight vs. Zero connections:**  
  
Highly skilled rival swordsmen from platformer games who look similar to the protagonist.  
  
They lead a group of warriors (the Meta-Knights and the Maverick Hunters).  
  
Both have mysterious pasts, and are mysterious in general.  
  
Both are rivals/allies of a protagonist that copies the abilities of others, and they sometimes join the protagonist on their adventures. Sometimes they fight the protagonist. Sometimes alternate versions of them fight the protagonist, and sometimes they have no control of their actions.  
  
In their first chronological appearance, they were tasked with being enemies to the protagonist (Zero was built to destroy Mega Man, and by extension X, by Dr. Wily. Meta Knight guarded a piece of the Star Rod from Kirby for King Dedede). Both of them have been villains before (Zero until Sigma defeated him, Meta Knight in Revenge of Meta Knight).  
  
Both have fought evil versions of themselves (Dark Meta Knight &amp; Galacta Knight, Omega). There are also evil versions of both (Morpho Knight and Zero Nightmare) who they did not fight (Morpho Knight's battle is not canon, X fought Zero Nightmare).  
  
In their own stories (Meta Knightmare/Mega Man Zero 3) Galacta Knight and Omega are the respective final bosses. They are known as the strongest warriors in their worlds and former legendary heroes who were sealed away due to fear of their power. Meta Knight/Zero have a climactic battle with them and are victorious.  
  
Both are seen as equals to (if not more powerful than) the protagonist. By defeating the strongest warriors in their worlds, they prove this.  
  
Both of them mentor the main character early on.  
  
Both have thematic relations to the word ""nightmare"", and both have fought things called Nightmare. For Meta Knight, Nightmare (the final boss) and Nightmare Enterprises in the anime. Meta Knight's subgames are called Meta Knightmare. For Zero, the Nightmare enemies, the Nightmare Virus itself, and the Nightmare Investigators. Zero also has a history of having nightmares.  
  
Both characters are involved in a surprising reveal: Meta Knight looking like Kirby and Zero being Dr. Wily's last creation.  
  
Both are the last of their kind (Meta Knight is part of a dying race and one of the last Star Warriors, Zero is the last Robot Master).  
  
At one point, they were forced to fight and kill someone close to them (Knuckle Joe's father and Iris).  
  
Both of them have temporarily given their sword to the protagonist.  
  
Similar abilities. Both of their swords (Galaxia and the Z-Saber) are renowned weapons that can attack with fire, electricity, wind, ice and darkness. They can heal themselves, shoot energy blasts, create duplicates of themselves, grow bat wings for flight, etc.  
  
Both have a personal insignia on their left shoulder pads.  
  
Both are overpowered in a crossover fighting game (Meta Knight in Brawl, Zero in MvC3).  
  
It's a rivalry matchup and a legacy matchup.",/r/DeathBattleMatchups/comments/sg00dz/what_popular_match_up_do_you_hate_and_why/huvx622/

Once I made enough progress to select trade targets I saw that the in social media feed that the Warriors were shopping Klay around and I selected him as my trade target and I simulated a few games and we acquired him for Issac Black I believe, but anyway the key to getting good players to play to their full potential is to go into coach settings and setting offensive play calling to auto and turning your play art and messages to all and full+lite. You’ll notice that the team will play more responsively especially if you give in and play within your offensive as they call plays for you and your teammates. It’s just up to you if you have the patience to adapt to actually playing with the team. I myself prefer to play this way as I have a PG and play with Boston and found to my liking they run the best offensive for a PG, as you’ll find yourself coming off many picks and set up shots real Golden State Steph Curry like. Also Boston runs the best sets for Kyrie or Steph Curry type of builds at PG. Again, I hope this helps.",/r/NBA2k/comments/sgf5zm/klay_thompson_is_allergic_to_threes_in_mycareer/huvx937/

* *Description:* This game sometimes has the subtitle “Caveman Ninja” but has dropped it in some ports of the game, including this iteration.

* *Description:* Trigger Witch comes from developer Rainbyte, who previously worked on the Zelda-inspired New Zealand-based Reverie. Like that game, Trigger Witch takes place in a 16-bit top-down fantasy world, but juxtaposed with the more traditional fantasy elements are realistic modern guns and enemies that splatter with blood when shot, which can be turned off in the options menu if you’re looking to dial down the rating. While magic has been outclassed by guns in this universe, you’ll still use your broomstick for some shoot ‘em up sections.

huvxxo2,Ramninja776,2022-01-30 11:01:40,"Well there's not an even distribution between male and female gamers. I play all sorts of games, including many live games. Go to a Magic: The Gathering tournament or go to a League of Legends live event. Mostly men. It's not bad to want the game to be tailored toward the audience. I'd be fine if a couple games came out here and there that were marketed primarily to female gamers. But that isn't what's happening. More and more new games have shitloads of tough, gruff women. And not just that, but they're the toughest, gruffest people in the game. Just like real life, right? Most prisoners in the U.S. are women, right? 

I already said that women can be warrior npcs in games. Why are you glossing over that? I said of halflings that it makes sense that most of them are pickpockets in Bg. They're renowned for their skills in that domain. Are women renowned as being the best warriors of all time? Females don't have to earn their right to exist in games; everything should be portrayed in a way that makes sense. That's the point. Should we be able to set the walls of Candlekeep on fire as if they were made of paper? Just because there's magic in a world doesn't mean we throw out all the rules. Most women don't act like these characters, it's just a few. So why should way more than a few be portrayed than this? How is that supposed to appeal to a mostly male audience?  

Well, I'm sorry you think it's toxic. I'll humbly disagree. It would be toxic if I 1) Opposed women playing games at all or 2) If I though there shouldn't be female warriors at all (which I've already said is not the case for me). I don't think you're using the word toxic in a particularly responsible manner. You haven't described my words or intent in the slightest.",/r/baldursgate/comments/sge11g/lets_argue_even_more_more_serious_this_time/huvxxo2/

I've long been a supporter of the downtrodden and peripheral, so I support all the marginalized, from women, to low income, to LGBTQ, to age, to able-bodiedness, etc. It seems blatantly obvious that if you want a better society for anyone then it needs to be better for all.

So, yeah, they've been raised on books about famous females, and I discuss when I read with theme each night, so I pause and discuss historical context and such.

I appreciate the names shared, as I don't know either, so will check them out ASAP.

I think its less about keyboard warriors and more about basic profit seeking behavior. For example if suddenly there was a bunch of literal nazi rehtoric showing up on reddit, there would be a bunch of news articles complaining about it, groups like the ADL and SPLC would start listing them as hate sites etc. and advertisers (their source of revenue) would run for the hills. As long as there's a profit motive for these companies, or more specifically that their business models are based on advertising dollars they're going to heavily regulate speech on their platforms. Asking them not to is essentially asking for them to go out of business.",/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sgf2xs/the_only_difference_between_the_us_and/huvy74w/

And then he is responsible for the deaths of countless Paradisians when the walls crumble or when he allowed the Warriors to kill the Yeagerists, which you say it's a necessary sacrifice, but i call that hypocrisy since not once did we saw Eren show any sign of regret or remorse over the Paradisians that he killed.

That is what i meant by telling you that Paradis is not that big of a deal to Eren, since the whole birthright dilemma is something that goes along with who Eren is as a person, it's not about Paradis, it's about him and the ideology that he has since birth and he projects that ideology into every single human that can be born. 

It just so happens that the euthanization plan would affect Eldians only, both the ones in Paradis and the ones in the outside world.

He got mad at Frieda because she said that Eldians (she didn't say Paradisians, she said Eldians specifically) should just embrace their deaths for the greater good, but that is not enough for Eren since he would never let himself die like cattle.

Chapter 120 and 121 aren't about Eren fighting for Paradis and its people, it's about Eren rejecting the views that he is completely against, the euthanization plan and allowing himself to die like cattle, it's his sense of justice.",/r/titanfolk/comments/sg7hg4/one_of_the_biggest_proofs_of_erens_retcon_if_he/huw06q1/

huw1ez6,Yoshikage23,2022-01-30 11:23:40,"The most fertile place on earth you say? Well, if you have done minimal research you would have known that in Russia there Has been routine famines in agriculture for a long time. And in soviet union, aside from these natural causes, kulaks have also played a major role by raiding and destroying livestock in collective farms. Here is a text which details it:

""Part of the problem was that for generations, a new class of peasants had begun to form who were able to buy and own land, gradually displacing the former feudal system where most of the land was used by peasants for distant landowners who weren't really interested in the region.

This new landlord class (kulaks) basically perpetuated the same feudal system, with other peasants continuing to work for them on the land they acquired. Naturally this exacerbated wealth inequality in the region and gave the landlord class relative privilege and control over the peasant workers.

When the famine hit and people started to starve, the landlord class was relatively insulated from the problem, even being able to hoard food and resources. As the workers became more desperate, they were willing to work for less food, which allowed the landlords to hoard more, which made the workers position more desperate, causing them to be willing to work for less, and so forth in a snowball effect.

All of this was pretty normal for the region. It was a problem, with the relatively wealthy hoarding wealth and the workers becoming increasingly desperate to work for them in the middle of a natural disaster, but it was a problem the region had been dealing with for hundreds of years, if not longer. The new landlordism wasn't particularly parasitic when compared to feudalism, but it was parasitic nonetheless.

When people started starving to death the government stepped in and started organizing collective farms, redistributing land and hoarded resources to the peasants so that they could work for and feed themselves in a more efficient, equitable model for everyone.

The landowning class however, like capital controlling classes throughout history, weren't satisfied to work for themselves and allow the peasants to work for themselves alongside them.

Their response was to start sabotaging the collective farms, and to begin raiding and destroying depots where food was being distributed to starving people, as well as burning fields, grain silos, and slaughtering livestock, including breeding stock and egg and dairy producing stock.

Even anti-Communist propagandists like Robert Conquest (whose propaganda was cited extensively during the Cold War before most of it was debunked and he was forced to recant his claims over and over again) claim that the landowning class destroyed about 96 million head of cattle, and possibly twice as much tonnage of grain and other foodstock, completely wrecking the food production capacity of the region in the middle of the famine and exacerbating the problem beyond anything seen before.

The death toll is vastly overblown by those who want to make it out to be a genocide perpetrated the the Soviet government against her own people. The aforementioned Robert Conquest initially claimed a completely unrealistic 20-30 million deaths, before revising his claim by several million just years after his now infamous propaganda piece was published, and again as low as 13-15 million deaths decades later when his claims were immediately and categorically disproven by the opening of the Soviet archives.

As genuine investigative research continues to debunk claim after claim made by propagandists like him, the numbers continue to dwindle and the legacy of the self-proclaimed ""Cold Warriors"" is continuously eroded. To this day, the Ukrainian government claims ~4 million cases of starvation in the region during that period, completely disregarding blatantly false ""research"" conducted from a time before evidence was even available.

Eventually before his death, Conquest was forced to admit that there was no way the Soviets could have caused the famine, although he stubbornly refused to admit that they did anything to prevent it or that the land-owning capitalist class destroying 2-4 million tons of food for every starving person and wrecking the productive capacity of the region might have been responsible, despite this being the inevitable conclusion of his lifelong body of work, ironically vindicating the Soviets through desperate attempts to portray them as villains.""

A tank cannot wreck a healer, and they never really have. Even in wrath with cross specs, prot warriors came the close and they STILL weren't that amazing and were outstripped by other specs or warrior, and yet blizzard still nerfs Tanks. If a tank spec can hold its own against a dps, I'm not saying out dps it, but hold its own, blizzard will nerf them to the ground. No tank spec has ever been meta, they've just been not trash, and yes blizzard still nerfs them, which is my issue. 

You find cc and counterplay unfun? You prefer that within 30 seconds you know how a fight is going to go? Sounds like a lack of strategy or focus to me. I see nothing wrong with a 10 minute long arena match, as long as it's intense, which blizzard has done a fair job of pressuring teams into combat.

As for blizzard giving into the majority, that's a deadly hole to go down for devs. That's what gave us BfA. That's what gave us legendaries every xpac. Listening to the community is nice in theory, but the simple fact is the people who moan the most are not the majority, and when it comes to balance issues, overall I say don't listen to the community, but instead look at data. The think blizzard DOESN'T listen to that should listen to, is concept critiques.

You keep saying ""when Tanks are having fun, Noone else is having fun"", and idk what you're basing this off of other than your own, personal believe and experience?

huw3kw2,HotspurJr,2022-01-30 11:37:29,"That's certainly the hope, but is it a reasonable  *expectation?* 

I mean, if you look at 20 years of picks, ending in say 2017 (since Ayton may well make an all-NBA team, although it's far from a given) you've got Olowokandi, Kenyon Martin, Kwame Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennet, Wiggins, Fultz - that's 8 out of 20 who never made an all-NBA team. 

So that's a 60% chance of getting somebody who makes any all-NBA team once. (Which technically is an all-NBA player, but I also don't really think that's what you meant by the term).

Interestingly, Wiggins is clearly the best of the players on that list. And when all is said and done, he may well go down as having a better career than one or two of the guys who made all-NBA teams (that's certainly the case if, say, the Warriors make a deep playoff run while Ben Simmons continues to do whatever he's been doing). There are a few other players on the ""made an all-NBA team"" list from the first-picks-in-the-last-20-years guys he could pass, as well - Karl Anthony Towns, for example, will always be a better offensive player, but Wiggins is clearly a better defender. I don't remember enough about Elton Brand as a defender but that could come down to how you value a high-quality role player on a winning team vs a guy who carries bad teams nowhere. 

Which is long way of saying: Wiggins is very very close to being the *median #1 pick* of the past 20-or-so years. 

When a player is the median player for his draft position, him being a disappointment says, I think, more about us than it does about them.",/r/nba/comments/sgg90k/what_will_be_the_legacy_of_andrew_wiggins/huw3kw2/

The biggest difference with the Warriors is that they simply don't ask him to do that. ""Hit open threes, set picks, and cut through open space created by Curry and Klay's gravity."" Every so often you see him try to create offense on his own and he still does the ""Take a couple of dribbles, pull up for a long two"" thing - but he does it less and less. 

People tend to be dismissive of that, because it feels like anybody can do it. But Wiggins does it at a very high level because of his insane athleticism. He needs less space that most players to punish teams for creating those gaps. 

He's also become an outstanding perimeter defender. 

Honestly I think him being an all-star is totally reasonable. A starter? Not so much. (I probably would have had him as an injury-replacement all-star.)

The book ['The Unknown Warriors'](https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Nicholas-Pringle/dp/1409271749) by Nicholas Pringle is a collection of letters from Second World War veterans with memories of wartime and thoughts on life since the end of the war and the country today.

&gt;  
&gt;As a group, they feel furious at not being able to speak their minds. They see the lack of debate and the damning of dissenters as racists or Little Englanders as deeply upsetting affronts to freedom of speech. **'Our British culture is draining away at an ever increasing pace,' wrote an ex-Durham Light Infantryman, 'and we are almost forbidden to make any comment.'**",/r/LouderWithCrowder/comments/sg8o5v/canada_is_now_the_front_line_this_will_be_the/huw5551/

huw6ksd,PrideAndEnvy,2022-01-30 11:56:52,"Most classes have something to offer in a small group play context. 

You wanna ideally have a balance of damage, support, a bit of tankiness and utility.

An example would be warrior + thief, thieves can grant stealth to both as a get out of jail card/combat reviver, while the warrior provides a bit of tankiness, a decent amount of boons with For Great Justice, and good amount of cc.

Necro has summons that can tank, but can't buff as well as warriors or guardians. So the theme here is to add a guardian or warrior to help provide in combat buffs.

Mesmers have a lot of utility in portals, stealth, and clones to help tank, but doesn't have as much boon output. But Mesmer + Guardian/Warrior work quite well together. 

The pattern here is really to pair a warrior and guardian with any other class and you have a good duo for leveling purposes. I'd recommend against ele because although they're really powerful in the right uands, they're pretty squishy for leveling purposes.

Meanwhile Simmons never plays another meaningful minute of playoff basketball.

Both of those are pretty reasonable possibilities. 

I'd be pretty comfortable calling Wiggins better. I think Simmons got some of those all-star nods based on hype more than production, and, for all the talk about how Wiggins is being carried by his current teammates (which have some truth to them!) Simmons was being carried offensively by Embiid (and had Embiid backing him up on defense, too). 

KAT, meanwhile, vanished in his one playoff series to date. It's not just a ""lack of experience"" - it's a (small) track record of failure. 

I want to be clear that I'm rooting for KAT to turn that around. I'm just saying there are very real questions about his ability to translate his transcendent skills into actual wins.",/r/nba/comments/sgg90k/what_will_be_the_legacy_of_andrew_wiggins/huw76bk/

Shangrila (SL) closes Nightmare and Brutal while Hunters Blade (HB) downs Ultra Nightmare and Nightmare. Eternal Helm (EH) Closes Ultra Nightmare, Nightmare, and Brutal!

Sure because it isn't fun

That just doesn't really happen with tanks. The match can't really be intense for 10 minutes against a tank

Nope

no longer have to be in the exact same physical location as where you are
standing. This knowledge updates in future worlds. You are also able to open
portals to other parallel dimensions should they exist naturally in the setting, such
as the Never Never in Dresden files, Heaven and Hell in DC, or parallel realities
in Marvel for example. You are limited to the local multiverse until post-spark,
upon which you can go anywhere.


From Dragon Ball Heroes
.Battle Power Limit 100 CP
-No matter how weak or powerful you are able to hold back so as to not badly harm others



From Dragon ball Super
Family Man- 100
It’s a pretty hard life, growing up as the child of the saviour of the world. Harder still if your parent is
never around to help you get through it all. Your kids won’t ever have to put up with such problems
though, since you’re always able to make time for them. With this, you become a fantastic parent, skilled at a variety of tasks related to raising children and teaching them the way you want them to
be taught. But beyond that, you are somehow always able to balance your work, training and
personal life to ensure that you never neglect your family. Even with an incredibly busy life, you’ll
always be able to steal at least an hour or two each day just for your family.




From Generic Sex world
100cp-Play their body like a fiddle.
You possess an unmatched ability to pleasure your partner(s). Not only is this pure sexual skill,
knowing instictually exatcly what to do to bring someone to a mind melting orgasm, but you
posses the abilty to induce amazing by just playing with their body. For example, playing with a
composed, haughty, tsundere princesses breasts is enough to cause her to orgasm multiple
times in a row. You could even make someone cum just from brushing the back of their neck.
In bed you quickly prove yourself unmatched. You possess unlimited stamina, with rapid
climaxes being the norm for anyone with you and you could bring someone to orgasm simply
with foreplay. Even a drunken one-night stand would be an experience they’d remember for
their entire life.
Additionally, you possess a limitless lifeforce that not only allows you to survive having sex with
a succubus, or similar beings, but turn the tables and give them a night they won’t soon forget.
You can also interact with spirits/ghosts as easily as if they were corporeal beings. For fun, or
otherwise.


100cp-Tame the beast
You have the ability to 'tame' someone's body. First this lets you ruin your partners for others,
ensuring that they can never be truly satisfied by anyone except you, to the point that even the
physical embodient of sexual pleasure couldnt get so much as a gasp out of them, receiveving
only groans if disapointmemt and a bored face instead.
This also ensures their loyalty, giving them the effect of the above loyalty perk. The speed at
which this happens depends on how much pleasure you bring them, with a normally skille
person requirung months of near constant sex, whereas utilizling the perk ""Play their body like a
fiddle."" would allow you to accomplish this in a day of nonstop sex. And if you were even better,
then you could tame someone with a single thrust.
Secondly, you can 'train' them, molding their personalities and fetishes to your liking. This can
be done without taming them first, though it takes significantly longer. Merely exposing them to a
fetish will start the process, as anyone you get with will be willing to try anything once. How
much they come to enjoy something is up to you, anywhere from mildly enjoying a breast grope,
to cumming anytime you pat their head.






Free shit







Free A human bull that's hung like a horse.
This is a complimentary perk, granting you peak human sexual physique and performance. This
ensures you will always be the best lay on any mundane earth, with sexual stamina and
features, that while not superhuman, will still be more than enough to ensure your partner never leaves unsatisfied. This lets you maintain your physique with minimum exercise, and allows you
to design a new body for yourself, within human limits.


Super Power- Free
There’s no weaklings around here anymore. If you’re going to get into a bust up here, you’ll have to
be ready, as only the greatest warriors from every universe will matter. Due to the sheer power of
even the ordinary combatants in this story, you will be afforded a great deal of skill and strength for
free. You have enough power to destroy an entire universe with your stronger attacks and skill to
put you on the level of some of the best fighters in the universe you come from. You’d be able to
give Goku in his Super Saiyan God form an excellent battle but would be more likely to lose than win, for a example of your power and skill. This may change depending on what else you purchase, of
course.



.The Adventure Doesn't End (free)
-No matter how strong you get, you can always find a worthy challenge to prevent boredom.


Comic Book Pretty (0 cp): Wow, you look like you walked off the pages of a
comic book. Luckily for you it was a realistic one so while you are rippling with
muscles, or while you may have amazing curves, those muscles are not the size

For one if you’re using enough to have a mark like that on your arm then you fucked up somewhere and probably wouldn’t be using that arm for much, let alone for jet skiing. Missed shots that leave your arm looking like that can leave you permanently disabled. Once you begin injecting opiates the large majority of people don’t stay fucking around on weekends for long. Chipping is widely viewed as a stepping stone to full on addiction, especially if you’re playing with needles. Popping pills is one thing, but the amount of people shooting heroin on weekends is very low in my experience using between 2015-2020 (especially now that it’s all fentanyl that is like heroin “crack”.) If you yourself are one of these “weekend warriors” I wish you luck. I love opioids, I will likely never be free from them having started at 14 myself. I’ve been on Suboxone 2 years, I have no clue how I will ever survive without it. Even after 2 years off needles I still think about it every day. If you use I hope you can stay safe, this shit kills far more today than it did when I began using in 2015. Chipping with fentanyl is a whole new game than chipping with heroin. If they still had good dope around that wasn’t full of fentanyl I’d probably be using right now.

huwawzy,Theolaa,2022-01-30 12:24:31,"Hello, everyone!

Today we are very excited to share with you ESU's brand new estates! We have worked very hard over the last several months to develop several lore-friendly estates which replace the standard set of vanilla ones.

In the first image, you'll see the Estate Window, with a typical selection of estates (there are a few additional ones that you can get under special circumstances). They are as follows:

* Mages: An estates focused on scholarship, research, and learning - although they aren't above wielding political power if given the chance.
* Commoners: Primarily concerned with peace and prosperity, and an important source of your nation's manpower.
* Merchants: Traders and Businessmen who prefer peace, but also know how to leverage wartime stresses to their advantage.
* Warriors: The elite fighters in your realm. They must be kept happy or you risk them turning their violent tendencies towards you...
* Priests: The religious leaders of the realm. Their support is invaluable in successfully spreading your religion within your borders.
* Nobility: The leading figures of your country. They often have the ear of your ruler and those closest to them, and are typically the most influential estate in the game. Their support - or lack thereof - can make or break your regime.

You will also notice that there are three new estates interactions which you can take. They primarily allow you to manipulate the loyalty and influence of all estates at once, but they are very expensive to use.

The second image shows off a selection of the estate disaster events. We mostly just think that the re-sized event window and event images look neat :)

The final three images showcase a selection of estate privileges that are available. Some of them have additional flavour events tied in with them, so play around with them and see which ones you like best!

Additionally, there are some 200 estate agendas which are split roughly evenly between the different estates. You'll recognize  most of them, like agendas for building certain buildings or increasing development in a certain province, but there are some new ones in there as well!

This overhaul of ESU's estates is part of a wider effort to bring custom, hand-crafted Elder Scrolls content to areas which until now have been re-skinned vanilla content. We are very excited to be continuing our efforts to make ESU a unique experience, so stay tuned for future content including National Ideas (We are about 85% finished creating culture-based national ideas for the whole map), Missions trees, and more!

But with some help and an awesome pep talk from the Owl he decided to keep moving forward. He made it all the way through titan infested lands to the wall on his own, a difficult task even for experienced shifters. He kept his secrets hidden for some 11+ years and all by himself he discovered the identity of the royal family and successfully retrieved the founding titan, something that 3 highly trained Marleyan warriors were completely unable to do. And on top of all that he was a kickass doctor that saved many lives and he had a loving family. Dude was a total badness.

If Murray is not 100% and we have to have Morris and Barton heavy minutes on their lead guards, or stick Gordon to them and leave their forwards with a guard, things get significantly more dicy. Gordon on Mitchell is more safe because the Jazz play small, Barton on one of their forwards is not a mismatch, since their forwards are guards, but agains the Suns, the Warriors, the Grizzlies and even the Mavs that's a recipe for disaster.",/r/denvernuggets/comments/sgaxg4/gdt_nuggets_2721_bucks_3120_jan_30_2022_500_pm/huwccep/

I don't think this is true imo. He might have chucked up a bunch of shots since coming back, but most of the issues come with Jordan Poole and Wiggins feeling him out and it looks like they're getting a hang of his presence.

Otherwise, everything has been the same.

huwe6pp,calviso,2022-01-30 12:44:29,"Have to make a few assumptions here, unfortunately. 

So assuming the 2022 Luxury Tax Threshold is $145M, and the other 14 Warriors roster spots are:

1. Curry	 $48,070,014 
* Klay	 $40,600,080 
* Wiggins	 $33,616,770 
* Green	 $25,806,469 	
* Looney	 $5,592,857 
* Poole	 $3,901,399 
* DLee	 $2,152,000 
* JTA         $2,126,991
* Wiseman $9,603,360 
* Kuminga	 $5,739,840 
* Moody	 $3,740,160 
* 29th pick $1,772,400 
* Vet Min	 $1,766,970 
* Vet Min	 $1,766,970 

	
That's a 2022 salary of $186,256,280 and a 2022 tax of $183,479,890 for a combined $369,736,170. 

For reference their 2021 bill is $378,527,129.

But, again, that's only 14 players on the roster.

So, if the 15th roster spot goes to another Vet Min contract, then that will cost them an additional $13,694,018, or $383,430,188 in total. 

If the 15th spot goes to the full 2022 TPMLE of $6,149,000, then that's $48,857,390 more or $418,593,560 in total.

And if they blow their load and give GPII a $10M contract as the 15th roster spot then that's $81,256,280 more, or a total bill of $450,992,450.",/r/nba/comments/sgepye/gary_payton_ii_i_want_to_stay_in_golden_state/huwe6pp/

\-Evilswarm Thanatos: Uneffected by monster effects beatstick, not super useful but can win you the game against certain decks.

\-Kachi Kochi Dragon, Ouroboros, Thunder Spark Dragon, etc: All somewhat useful but either meh or possible but difficult to summon. You're not gonna use these at all due to tiny extra deck space but they do have their uses nonetheless.

Really, the biggest issue for Phantom Knights atm seems to be more so a tiny extra deck than it is a lack of consistency or ability to go into your extra deck. Especially since you'll want 2-3 Break Swords if you ever plan on going into your Rank 4's (which is just in general a better pool of monsters to pick from). 

If you're going for a Rank 3/4 hybrid deck, then 2-3 slots will be taken up by Break Sword, which means you'll have 4-5 extra deck slots remaining for your other Rank 3's and 4's, which isn't a lot. Plus, it's not like your main deck monsters will be winning you games on their own - unlike their direct Rank 3/4 spam deck competition: Magnet Warriors, which have their own gameplan &amp; wincon separate from their extra deck, allowing them much more versatility and longevity (plus one of if not the best Rank 3's in Yugioh with Gorgonic Guardian).

Atm, it looks like PK is gonna be a worse Magnet deck, but it's hard to say whether or not that'll keep it out of the meta. It could very well be that it makes it to tier 3 status anyways. Especially with a searchable fiendish chain (that's also better in every way) via a skill.",/r/DuelLinks/comments/sfnzh6/do_you_think_the_mini_box_will_make_phantom/huwfgko/

Also, his first name 'Remus' is the name of one of the brothers that were raised by a wolf in Roman mythology.

Other examples are

Hermione: Hermes is the god of cleverness and is regarded as a messenger, Hermione is also very quick witted and clever, so the name is fitting.

Bellatrix : Literally means female warrior, Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort's most tenacious warriors.

Voldemort:  Means flight from death/or running away from death. This was Voldemort's main goal to remain alive and perserve himself.",/r/harrypotter/comments/sgcqe7/i_feel_so_dumb_for_just_realizing_this/huwfobx/

huwftug,ohmygoditsaraptor,2022-01-30 12:54:28,"Sure, It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die.  
Yet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse.  
To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.""",/r/SCJerk/comments/sgb73c/podcast_with_100_followers_on_the_topic_of_a_show/huwftug/

huwgd21,capc2000,2022-01-30 12:57:46,"Call me hopeful but I think that even with a rookie in mid, the Dragons can still win worlds. Layers was a rookie and he made it as far as the Finals, there's no way that the Dragons don't have a shot. I guess it all depends on the synergy between Sam and Pegon. 

For Titans and Scarabs, I think that the Titans look solid but might tumble. SOT is a great guy but I feel like he gets caught too much in drama. There was the Renegades drama and now there's the Toilet drama. I can see during the mid-season that something will shake up the roster for Titans, especially if they go on a losing streak. Scarabs look solid and I am happy to see ScaryD back, even though I'm not a fan it's still good to see him back. They could be a really great team.

For the other unchanged teams, nice. Kings and Leviathans have no real reason to change teammates, they did pretty well. Kings lost to the champs that 3-0 the most dominant team in the latter half of the season so there are no hard feelings. For Bolts, I would think they would change Haddix because they changed SOT and didn't keep Variety last season but at least Haddix gets to keep proving his worth. For Warriors, hopefully, this new season is good to them. Ping diff did not help and I'm a bit iffy on keeping Qvofred and Neilmah but I can see myself getting proven wrong if the team gets on even ground as everyone should.

Now for the spiciest team, eh. I'm not a fan honestly. I can see them getting replaced by whatever team gets to win the playins. It might be hard for Hurri to transition from Mid to Support but I believe he can be a great leader. However, if his team loses to a playins team then I wouldn't be surprised.",/r/smitepro/comments/sghtxs/approved_discussion_of_unconfirmed_roster_leaks/huwgd21/

Also, it gets frustrating to debate this with casuals because the guy went for 37 points in a fucking quarter! There are top 75 players that didn't have 37 points as a career high in a game! He went for 60 points in 3 quarters and only dribbled 11 times! He's a specialist. He carried the warriors over the thunder.

huwgofw,Tdmcguire12,2022-01-30 12:59:44,"Glad we could come to a compromise and tbh I’ve been dying to discuss some of this. For a summary of my thoughts:

Leviathans and Kings I agree staying as they were was the best possible decision. Let them continue to grow together.

Love the Titan’s change, the Splyce fanboy in me wanted Scream to go there but I think that team has a lot of potential.

Scarabs I think are just as good, they have a role playing playmaker in ScaryD (I know that’s an oxymoron but it’s fitting for him.

Dragons I’m cautiously optimistic, Pegon has the potential to be another Paul-level Rookie, I kinda wish they went in a new direction with either Solo or Jungle just for some variety but it still looks like a solid roster.

I hate that the Bolts didn’t make a change, that roster struggled a lot the second the meta changed and I’m concerned that they’ll have struggles as the meta evolves again. Hope I’m proven wrong though.

Warriors I have no real opinion on until we see how they do on lan, though I will stand on the hill that they should’ve gotten a new support.

As for the last team… 3 pros that haven’t had success since S5 or older, a role-swapped Hurriwind I have no idea what to think about, and a rookie. I don’t quite have the faith that roster will pull a scarabs. Kinda expect another Valks just on lan.",/r/smitepro/comments/sghtxs/approved_discussion_of_unconfirmed_roster_leaks/huwgofw/

&amp;#x200B;

EW is, in my opinion, the best Xcom title ever made, to date. It adds two major player soldier mods (Cybernetic augmented mec warriors &amp; and genetic modded warriors). It adds an entirely new game mechanic in the form of Meld, which essentially adds pressure to each map that has it. It adds two new alien enemies, one heavy-hitter and one stealthy. It adds and entirely new enemy class and mission types. EXALT enemies are handled with covert operations and extractions, and require you to eventually figure out where the EXALT base is located on the global strat map. There are several new foundry projects, new technology, and a number of changes to class abilities. The story missions that are added are all excellent and the AI is improved.

I have over 4 thousand hours in this game for a reason. And I've found that those who claim it's not worth the trouble have actually never played it, or tried it and got their shit pushed in. EW is WELL worth your time. It's a major improvement over EU and continues to be fun for me years after I bought it at PC release.

huwlvq8,KiwiArms,2022-01-30 13:30:57,"Now, 'Hell' was something of a misnomer. It was certainly hell*ish*, and more than looked the part, but it wasn't a place for the damned that Ben found himself in. Rather, it was something far more accepting of all types of people, from all along the spectrum of morality: The Netherworld. Where souls that were lost ended up, be they good, evil, or undecided.

Elsewhere in the Netherworld, entire cosmologies away, there was a river. The Sanzu. Its waters had raised significantly in recent years, and in the process had dredged up something thought lost to the depths. A skeletal junk, hardly fit to float, let alone sail. And yet, it floated all the same.

Juzo looked out at the familiar craft from a cliff across the way,  ""A boat without its captain. How pitiful. To think, a ghost ship could exist even here...""

""Almost like a metaphor,"" said a girl who, without Juzo's knowledge, had been sitting not far from him the whole time. ""For what, though, who knows.""

He assessed this new presence. She clearly wasn't a Gedoshu, so her presence was honestly perplexing to him. He brought a hand to his chin, scratching his beard. ""This is no place for a young girl, you know.""

""Well,"" she said, ""it's not like I have anywhere better to be."" She produced a fishing rod, and cast her line into the dead river below.

""...You won't catch anything, not in this river. It isn't a place that *sustains*, not living things, it only takes. Nothing that could survive these waters would be worth catching."" He shook his head. ""Trust me, I speak from experience.""

""Well, that just means I'll have to fish harder, then,"" she replied. ""I'm Lana.""

""...Juzo.""

""Well Juzo, I know why I'm here."" Lana hadn't made eye contact with him once so far. ""But what's a strapping fellow like yourself doing in a place like this?""

He chose to ignore the compliment. ""I'm wondering that myself, these days.""

""Lost your way, have you?""

He shook his head. ""If it were only that simple. I know my path, but I fear the path no longer exists. Washed away in the storm of circumstance. My fated partner, no matter where I go I cannot seem to find them again... I fear I may truly be alone.""

His words hung in the air for a bit, the silence only broken when Lana reeled in her line and recast it. A minute passed without words. The only sound was the Sanzu River's tainted waters gently crashing against the shore.

A ship without a captain, without a crew, with no destination. A ship that should, by all accounts, be sunken at the bottom of the river, rotting away and consumed by the elements. In a way, Juzo agreed with Lana's assessment: it was a startlingly accurate metaphor for the wayward samurai. His death at Takeru's blade was exactly what he'd wanted, wasn't it? And yet he still lived. Summoned into the world by some force unknown, without clear intention. Takeru was nowhere to be found, and all the warriors Juzo had encountered so far had been found lacking... was this, perhaps, his punishment? A cosmic joke at his expense? His karmic damnation, to wander the world forever, fighting countless foes, but never being satisfied by any of them? Given what he had always yearned for-- a lifetime of bloodshed-- without any passion for it?

The thought couldn't be stuffed down into his subconscious. He wouldn't be able to shake it, he hadn't been able to since he first woke back up. If he was truly destined to never find another warrior who could sate his desires, what was the point of continuing? Perhaps he should just give up. Perhaps this was a sign, the reemergence of the Rokumon. A sign that he should let the past fade away, let *himself* fade away, into the annals of history as nothing more than the memory of a monster.

""...So you're single then?""

""...""

The silence that followed *that* was of a different tone than the first one, though Lana certainly didn't seem to notice. ""Ah!"" Her line went taut, indicating she'd gotten a bite. ""About time!""

Juzo watched, intrigued, as the girl fought against whatever was snagged on her hook. It tried valiantly to break away, but her skills as a fisherwoman were second to none, it seemed. Thus, despite its great effort, in the end Lana won out, yanking the fish in with all of her might. She nearly toppled over, and Juzo found himself starting to go to catch her. Luckily, that wasn't necessary, as she regained her footing just in time to meet her capture face to face.

Given the great struggle it put up, Juzo had thought initially that she'd perhaps hooked a stray Ayakashi of some fashion. It would make sense, given where they were-- much more sense than what she actually caught. ""Ah, it's small,"" was her appraisal of the fish she held in her hand. ""A big-scaled redfin, too... ironic name."" She held the fish, barely larger than her palm, up to Juzo. ""Can you believe this? Just my luck.""

He started to respond, but trailed off. All of the sudden, his ears picked up on something they hadn't before. A woman, singing, somewhere. By the sound of it she was partway through a song, but he had somehow only just now begun to hear it. His ears twitched, trying to zero in on the source, only to come to a conclusion that didn't sit quite well with him: the Rokumon Junk. The boat that once housed Dokoku. The boat that was all too familiar to Juzo. ""Dayu?""

He listened a bit more, and ruled her out. This wasn't her voice. And besides that, he couldn't hear a shamisen. But if not her, then who? Had somebody taken the wreck as a home since last he'd been here?

""You go check it out,"" Lana said, ""I'll stay here in case any more fish show up."" She gave Juzo a thumbs up. ""Don't do anything stupid though, I wouldn't want you to ruin that face.""

""...it was interesting meeting you,"" Juzo said. ""I suggest you return home, lest you fall into the river."" And with that, he was off.

Lana cast her line again, ignoring his warning. Even if she *were* to heed it, after all, there was no 'home' to return *to* anymore. Not that he'd know that.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

""Ladies and gentlemen and others,"" shouted the horned woman in the middle of the ring, ""it's time once again for that yearly tradition we love so much! Our sole solace in this endless realm of boredom and misery!"" The crowd loved it. ""It's WresHellmania!"" Pyrotechnics shot up from the mouths of imps bound to the sides of the platform, cinders and sparks of which fell back down shortly afterwards into the eager faces of fans in the crowd. It was agonizingly painful, but they were hype for it. ""Our last sign melted on account of the hellfire, but we got a replacement! Hit it, Asmodeus!""

On cue, the demon named Asmodeus (as indicated by his nametag) pushed a button on his control panel. From his spot outside the crowd, he had a great view of the newly built sign descending into place: a long, rectangular mass of tumorous flesh and eyes held aloft on three pairs of tattered wings. It had fresh wounds, recently carved and burning bright with heat, in the shape of words. *WresHellmania DCLXVI*.

The crowd began to chant, ""This is awful!"", with emphasis on each word. They meant it as a positive, though.

""And cuz it's a special occasion,"" the woman continued, ""I got *special* permission from the people upstairs!"" The crowd fell hush, intrigued. ""A one time deal! Tonight only, for the first and last time! Get out of Hell *free!*"" Oohs, ahs, and 'what's followed her announcement. ""If you can beat the reigning champion in the ring, you'll be *free*! Released back into the world of the living, alive and everything!""

Well, that certainly sounded enticing. Especially to one Benjamin Kirby Tennyson, who really would rather not spend eternity in this dump. He pushed his way through the crowd, with the appropriate ""Sorry!""s and ""'Scuse me!""s, until he was up in the front row. ""Sign me up, lady!""

The woman scoffed, bending down to size him up. She brushed a few strands of blond hair from her face, only to hold back a laugh. ""Kid, you wouldn't last three seconds in the ring with the champ! Get outta here!""

Ben's confident smirk and crossed arms spoke for themselves. He'd been in the ring before, and was pretty dang good at it.

""I... hrm..."" He raised a good point. ""...you got a manager, kid?""

""Thaaaaat'd be me,"" Henderson said, carving his way through the crowd and into the conversation. ""Henderson, at yer service.""

The woman's eyes rolled. Clearly, she was as unhappy as Ben was with Henderson's presence. ""I know who you are.""

""And I know *you*, Beverly.""

She grit her pointed teeth. ""*Power*.""

Henderson raised a fist in solidarity. ""Hell yeah sister, fuck the white man. Point is, I'm the kid's manager...""

""No,"" Ben interjected, ""you aren't!""

""...and thus, I can assure you, with my Henderson seal of *ko-wa-luh-tee*, that he is the *best* wrestler ever sent to Hell!"" He was lying, of course. The *real* best wrestler in hell wouldn't answer his calls anymore. ""And since El Santo is currently off fighting Dracula, you're gonna need his talent if you want the main event to be exciting!

""Ben 10?"" Power snorted. ""What's that, your age, IQ, or length?""

""It's, uh--"" Ben began to gesture to his watch, but opted out. ""--well, I *was* ten when I got that nickname, I guess, but...""

huwlwmu,Skyy-High,2022-01-30 13:31:06,"&gt; Who said anything about wings 🤡 Stop deflecting. 

I did, and I said why. The real clown here is the guy who can’t follow a logical argument. 

&gt; For the record GW1 wings were part of a custome that was lore friendly and could not be worn as a single piece.

“Lore friendly” how? What demon was that? What enemy or faction in GW1 looked like that? It was totally out of left field for the game at that point, and there was quite a lot of bitching on forums (yes, forums, cause GW Reddit wasn’t really a thing yet; I’d like to see you name the two most popular general-use GW1 forums from that time) about them when they were released.

&gt; We have very different memories of how many people used them then.

Yeah, I’m sure you saw a bunch of people using them in the first week and then never updated your mental model of how common they were. Or maybe you just get so enraged at “muh immersion” being broken - even though, if “lore friendly” excuses it, those weapons were given an entire backstory to justify their inclusion in the game - that simply seeing them at all is enough to make you forget that the majority of people didn’t use them. 

&gt; Ah yes that's why the guy in charge of GW1's and GW2's art direction was so disgusted by SAB he almost made Anet throw out the idea altogether.

1) Citation please, because I don’t trust the dude who thinks clown emojis are compelling counterpoints to be accurate with their summaries of events or opinions. 

2) Who cares? The game had holograms and time travel nonsense on launch, any objection of a holographic game world being “beyond the pale” for the tech of thr Tyria of GW2 is patently ridiculous. It’s grasping at straws to justify not including something because you don’t like it. 

You have no trouble dismissing the views and opinions of the devs constantly, but you want me to believe that you think the art director’s opinion is gospel *in this case in particular*? You don’t get to be mercenary about treating the devs as unimpeachable. 

&gt; It took less than 3 years for GW2 to reach this stage.

And?

It’s a shiny texture. Not a huge flashy particle effect, not a beacon of incandescent pain. The texture quality isn’t even that great (though I remember thinking it was cool in 2015, it’s in the BL statuette trader right now and I don’t even feel compelled to purchase them, even though I’ve had the medium set for years). 

Is your objection that it’s “breaking the lore” for our characters to be astral zodiac warriors? Explain to me how that makes less sense than our characters being some kind of demonic lich in GW1. 

If your objection isn’t based on the armor being overly flashy, and it’s not based on lore, and you’re just saying “characters shouldn’t look this magical and fantastical”…I mean, that’s your opinion, but the game wouldn’t have lasted 10 years without expanding the aesthetics options beyond “normal materials”. People like flash. The lore of this game clearly allows for flash (we are absolutely **saturated** with magic at this point in the story). 

It really just sounds like you’re salty that people get bored and want their fun meaningless game to be fun and shiny, but you don’t want to sound like a buzzkill so you’re dressing up your whining with empty platitudes about “lore” and “aesthetics”….but at the end of the day, you’re whining that the dude riding the fire breathing dragon doesn’t look sufficiently “real” to you.",/r/Guildwars2/comments/sg42ra/i_love_the_game_but_i_hate_where_gw2_went/huwlwmu/

huwnci8,NextMention20,2022-01-30 13:40:08,"The only way I see the voters giving Giannis DPOY this season, is if the Bucks finish with a top 5 defense. We are tied with the Clippers as the #8 defense currently, so we would realistically have to finish the season as a top 5 defense for Giannis to have a greater chance. We are very close to Dallas, Miami, and Memphis in defensive rating, so we do have a shot at jumping them by the end of the year. 

 Draymond had the award rapped up and the Warriors have the #1 defense in the league by a good margin, but it looks like he will be missing some significant time this season. So I am unsure if he will be getting the award. 

I don't see Gobert getting voted in as DPOY. He has been the most impactful defender this year by the metrics, but the Jazz have the #12 ranked defense. With voter fatigue  setting in for Gobert and the Jazz being ranked that low, I don't see him being voted in. 

Imo, the biggest competition for DPOY will be Bam and Allen/Mobley. Miami has the #7 defense currently and Bam is their anchor, so he has a good shot at getting voted in as DPOY. The Cavs have the #3 ranked defense and Mobley/Allen are both fantastic defenders (unsure who is better between the two). Ayton would have a shot on the #2 ranked Phoenix defense, but he has missed way too many games this year. 

As for MVP, I think it will ultimately come down to Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid. Curry had it locked up earlier this year, but he has played horrible for over 2 months straight, so he doesn't deserve MVP anymore. I think the Bucks finish with a better record than Denver and Philly, so Giannis would likely be the MVP in that instance. 


TL;DR: Giannis' biggest competition for DPOY will probably be Bam, Mobley, or Jarrett Allen. Draymond will be a lock for DPOY, if he can come back and play more games. For MVP, it will come down to Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid. Whoever finishes with the highest record, will probably be MVP this year.",/r/MkeBucks/comments/sgepk4/another_mvp_and_dpoy_season_for_giannis/huwnci8/

Dark Souls III is a 2016 action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It is the fourth overall entry of the Souls series and the final installment of the Dark Souls trilogy.  
  
It is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective. Players have access to various weapons, armour, magic, and consumables that they can use to fight their enemies. Bonfires serve as checkpoints. The Estus Flask is the consumable used for healing in Dark Souls III. Ashen Estus Flasks restore focus points (FP), which can be used for magic or weapon arts. Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the series, returned to direct the game after handing the development duties of Dark Souls II to others in FromSoftware.  
  
Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies within its first two months and over 10 million by 2020. Two downloadable content (DLC) expansions, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, were also made. A complete version containing the base game and both expansions, Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.

Dark Souls III is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective, similar to previous games in the series. According to lead director and series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, the game's gameplay design followed ""closely from Dark Souls II"". Players are equipped with various weapons to fight against enemies, such as bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Shields can act as secondary weapons, but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage. Each weapon has two basic types of attack, one being a standard attack and the other being slightly more powerful that can be charged up, similar to FromSoftware's previous game, Bloodborne. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling. Bonfires, which serve as checkpoints, return from previous instalments. Ashes, according to Miyazaki, play an important role in the game. Magic is featured in the game, with a returning magic system from Demon's Souls, now known as ""focus points"" . When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One refills hit points like previous games in the series, while the other refills focus points, a feature new to the game. Combat and movements were made faster and more fluid than Dark Souls II. Several player movements are performed more rapidly, allowing more damage to be done in a shorter period.  
  
Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviours. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles. New combat features are introduced in Dark Souls III, including weapon and shield ""Skills"", which are special abilities that vary from weapon to weapon and enable special attacks and features at the cost of focus points. The game focuses more on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide more tactical options. The game features fewer overall maps than its predecessor Dark Souls II, but they are larger and more detailed, encouraging exploration. The adaptability stat from Dark Souls II was removed in Dark Souls III, with other stats being adjusted, alongside the introduction of the luck stat. The game features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series.

Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged with the linking of the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, abandoned his duty and watched the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty. Meanwhile, Sulyvahn, a sorcerer from the Painted World of Ariandel, wrongfully proclaims himself Pontiff and seizes power over Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and the returning Anor Londo cathedral from Dark Souls as a tyrant.  
  
The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, rises and must link the fire by returning Prince Lothric and the defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in Firelink Shrine. The Lords include the Abyss Watchers, a legion of warriors, sworn by the Old Wolf's Blood which linked their souls into one, to protect the land from the Abyss, and were ultimately locked in an endless battle between each other; Yhorm the Giant, who was once a conqueror of the very people for whom he then sacrificed his life; and Aldrich, who became a Lord of Cinder despite his ravenous appetite for both men and gods. Lothric himself was raised to link the First Flame, but rejected his destiny and chose to watch the fire fade.  
  
Once the Ashen One succeeds in returning Lothric and the Lords of Cinder to their thrones, they travel to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame. There, they encounter the Soul of Cinder, an amalgamation of all the previous Lords of Cinder who had linked the flame in the past. Once the Soul of Cinder is defeated, four endings are made possible based on the player's actions during the game. The player can attempt to link the fire, summon the Fire Keeper to extinguish the flame and begin an age of Dark, or kill her. A fourth ending consists of the Ashen One taking the flame for their own and becoming the Lord of Hollows.

Ashes of Ariandel introduces a new area, the Painted World of Ariandel. On arriving at the Cathedral of the Deep in the base game, the Ashen One meets a wandering knight, Gael, who implores them to enter the Painted World and fulfil a prophecy to bring ""Fire for Ariandel."" Inhabitants of this world variously beg the Ashen One to burn the Painted World per the prophecy or leave it to its slow rot. A painter girl tells the Ashen One of ""Uncle Gael""'s promise to find her dyes to paint a new world. The player's decision to proceed elicits first coldness from the world's self-appointed guardian and then a boss fight, in which Ariandel is ultimately set on fire. The painter thanks the player for showing her flame and awaits Gael for the Dark Soul, which she can use to paint a new world for humanity.  
  
In keeping with previous franchise DLC, Ashes of Ariandel introduces a substantial new area, two boss fights and several new weapons, spells, and armour pieces.

In The Ringed City, the Ashen One begins their journey to an area known as ""The Dreg Heap"", a region where ruined kingdoms of different eras are piled upon each other as the world draws to a close. From the Dreg Heap, after battling through the ruins of Lothric Castle, the Ashen One encounters the amnesiac knight Lapp, who cannot remember his past. Throughout the Dreg Heap, messages from Gael from Ashes of Ariandel guide the player. The Ashen One traverses the remnants of Earthen Peak, an area encountered in Dark Souls II, before fighting the last remnant of the demon race, the Demon Prince, in the base of an Archtree that contains the ruins of Firelink Shrine from Dark Souls. Victorious, the player travels to the Ringed City, an ancient city of Pygmies, the ancestors of humanity, which has fallen into the Abyss. After defeating the guardian of the Church of Filianore, the player awakens Filianore, the daughter of Lord Gwyn who was entrusted to the Ringed City as a token of peace between Gwyn and the Pygmy Lords. This transports them to a ruined wasteland of ash, which can be interpreted as either a skip forward in time or the lifting of an illusion cast by Filianore. There, the Ashen One meets a disheveled Gael, who has begun killing the Pygmy Lords in order to gain the blood of the Dark Soul from the Pygmies for the painter girl in Ariandel to use as ink. After consuming the Dark Soul, Gael has been fully corrupted by its power and demands the Ashen One's portion of it. He is finally struck down, allowing the Ashen One to obtain his blood (which contains the Dark Soul), which the painter girl in Ariandel uses to paint a new world for humanity.

Yes of course!  
You start your adventure in an unfortified fortress, which you must expand step by step. In the lightly fortified fortress you only have the possibility to build 2 buildings. A fisher and a barracks are usually the first choice. In the barracks you can train warriors to defend your city  and attack. The fisher generates food to build warrior and upgrades.  
But to get gold, you have to force the english armee to give you some ;)  
Your fortress will grow after each upgrade and you will gain more space for more buildings (woodcutter, blacksmith, archery range, ect).  
However, since Vikings like to capture fortresses, you can also capture enemy fortresses and build a new one there.

huwop3x,RangerBat1981,2022-01-30 13:48:48,"40 year old white male who plays a female warlock awoken

Why? Because warlocks are my favorite class, awoken are awesome, and female as I play games to escape reality. My logic for ""escape"" means playing a character who is without question not me. Roleplaying as a female character allows me to truly invent a head canon completely dissimilar to myself.

I don't like who I am in reality. Being able to play a character I like to play, to pretend to be, is what I seek for personal entertainment. 

As for chats, friend invites, and clan invites? None. Not a one over the pass six months since starting fresh on Steam. I personally do not expect the characters I see in a live service game have the same gender as the player. Destiny rarely, if ever, mentions the player character's gender. We are all Guardians. Nameless warriors and demigods. 

As for gameplay experience? Not really. I do run with no helmets in social spaces because I make a face for my Guardian so why not show it? My character is a hero, a warrior, a monster hunter, and a slayer of Darkness. I don't feel my gender or even being awoken have any real influence. Now, I have always liked the awoken ascetic so having minor references which connect being an awoke to Petra and Sov is nice. 

Welcome to the game, by the way! Hope to see you out in the field, Guardian! For no better reason than there is loot to be had!",/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/sgjo61/woman_destiny_playersexperience_playing_as_a/huwop3x/

huwp6ks,ShotFoot,2022-01-30 13:51:50,"From what I gather, steppe pastoralists nomads at the time usually made their own various arrows, both at the household level but also in their nomadic city settlements that often had their own specialized labor making them, and with heads made out of bone, bronze, iron, and sometimes stone, depending on usage. As the John of Plano Carpini the noted in his emissary mission to the Mongol court in the 1240's noted:

*The men* \[Mongols\] *do not make anything at all, with the exception of arrows, and they also*  
*sometimes tend the flocks, but they hunt and practise archery, for they are all, big and*  
*little, excellent archers, and their children begin as soon as they are two or three years*  
*old to ride and manage horses and to gallop on them, and they are given bows to suit*  
*their stature and are taught to shoot; they are extremely agile and also intrepid. All the*  
*women wear breeches and some of them shoot like the men.*

Khans and Princes, especially with those with sedentary territory or vassals, would usually contract sedent manufacturers for large orders of specialized goods (such as iron arrowheads  shaped for better penetration of armor) and other specialized goods that couldn't be sufficiently supplied or procured by the households of the shepherd warriors. From the “Basic Annals” of Ögödei’s reign in the Yuanshi,: 

“*The imperial princes and all the notables also sent agents to Yanjing (Dadu) and down to the southern prefectures \[of the former Jin Dynasty\] in quest of commercial goods—\[ceremonial\] bows, arrows, saddles and bridals. Some \[sent agents\] to the Western Region and to the Uighurs to seek out and acquire pearls (zhuji) and some \[sent agents\] to the Eastern Sea (North Pacific) for gyrfalcons. Mounted couriers \[on these quests\] were continuous, \[traveling\] day and night without interruption, exhausting the populace beyond endurance.*""

Many Khans (Mongols especially) also tried to spare artisans deemed useful for their needs in settlements that they punished, and uprooted and took them to designations to which they could supply their skills to the Khan and his forces (which was often their own planned cities, but could be regional or Imperial capitals). Many of the immediate Chinggisids moved some of the 'deported' artisans to Karakorum or Chinqai Balasaghun in Mongolia, the latter becoming a manufacturing center for the region, where many of said artisans were armor, sword, and arrow smiths.",/r/WarCollege/comments/sg84jy/how_did_the_mongol_empire_manage_the_arrow/huwp6ks/

huwpkg5,kantian_insomia,2022-01-30 13:54:17,"&gt; If humans are the work of Ahura Mazda, why would he permit a spirit of evil to corrupt their souls?

Because he cannot finish ahriman by himself as he is incorruptible &amp; it is necessary for and his responsibility as well to finish all evil off. He creates humans &amp; the observable material universe to entrap ahriaman by means a reciprocal agreement deal &amp; aims to finish him off inside which is why he creates his warriors that shall aid him in doing so. Our fravashis and urvaans being one of them, both aspects of an individual soul. The fravashis which guide from menog, being incorruptible, but the urvaan that experiences material world/getig is indeed corruptible. This is the reciprocal agreement ahriman agrees upon. 

Pain and suffering are too strong a force to be simply denied, like some philosophies would like to think.

Mazdaen thought meets it as well as accepts it instead of denying it and has a place for it in its own cosmology. It isn't a negative result of acts in previous lives but a REALITY which is deeply rooted in the cosmic order and nature. It is an attribute of Angra Mainyu, the embodyment and root cause of all destruction, suffering, pain etc.

To understand that, one must understand Mazdaen cosmology and theology which are closely interlinked. In Mazdaen theology, Man is initially an agent of good in the cosmic fight as well as the fight inside of an idealistic conception because he is creation of Mazda. Man's existence itself is considered as a help for the final triumph of asha/arta.

In Mazdaen order humans enjoy a special position in the scheme of salvation and in cosmic dynamism because they have the power of absolute free will, as the supreme wise lord isn't omnipotent but omniscient and benevolent, as it resolves Euthyphro better than theodicy.

In times when evil/pain/suffering etc overwhelms us, they are realities and agents of ahriman that have to be fought whilst staying along the path of asha/arta i.e. being righteous for reasons to be explanied ahead.

In Mazdaen theology,  Man is initially an agent of good in the cosmic fight as well as the fight inside of an idealistic conception because he is creation of Mazda. Man's existence itself is considered as a help for the final triumph of asha/arta.

Coming to cosmology, over here then in principle duality, Ohrmazd becomes synonymous with light and goodness which becomes his principle and peculiar character and inherent nature, and evil necessarily has a different and independent origin.

These two principles (in the idealistic sense) and deities (in materialistic and cosmic sense) are now coeval, equally eternal in their respective relams and in an endless opposition/struggle. Ohramazd still maintains his divine superiority.

This whole cosmogeny or the evolution of universe is created to overcome the threat of evil from a theological standpoint. Now since the both exist without a beginning, they both are compelled to have no end,  logically, as well no beginning, because they both exist in a realm of infinite time or a place where time is non-existent. But this poses a problem, and that is it guarantees that there will emerge no one triumphant out of the fight and evil/ahriman will never be defeated.

Since Ohramazd/Ahura Mazda is omniscient and has the power of creation, he creates a realm of finite time in all his wisdom where he can trap ahriman or else engage with him eternally without beginning or end. So he creates finite time, amesha spenta and the world, all of which are his ""creations"", directly or indirectly. Then he nets ahriman into this realm of finite time to perish him in the end. This end is fixed by means of reciprocal agreement. Eschatologically Ohramazd is to win but that is of lesser importance.

What is of most importance is the fact that one must in any circumstances focus on doing deeds following the path of asha/arta. 

""Creation"" by itself now, serves as a field of battle, acting as a limited space, by allowing and netting ahriman, in, who lives darkness, Ohramazd exposes his ""creations"" to ruining and corrupting by Ahriman.

This also subsequently exposes us to suffering and adversary but us choosing asha/arta over it significantly raises the chances of ahriman's defeat and this is what Ohramazd in his infite wisdom has seen and asks us to follow.

Surely Ohramazd could've not gotten ahriman inside of his creation that space and time were but that would mean ahriman would never get annihilated or defeated completely.

The only way to defeat him and destroy him forever, is to face him directly as humans, fight it when necessary and reject it when necessary. Ohramazd cannot do this since he is all good, hence he nets ahriman inside his ""creation"" and finite time.

Another thing to remember is that one need to attack evil only in retaliation.

Now coming to the significance of evil i.e. ahriman, it is corroborated from Zarthustra's own life. That evil and ahriman acts as a lever to compel man to accept and face the fight, which points towards the prospective end of it (ahriman), provided the person in question who is deciding is righteous.

"" For the creatures engaged in the fight he (the wise lord), created alertness, so they can collect with their own struggle, the supreme happiness.""

With death, suffering(struggle/battle) ends and the those who have followed the path of asha/arta go to a state of highest consciousness and those who haven't go to a state of lowest consciousness.

It can never be emphasized more that the arms to fight this battle is asha/arta i.e. right action, right words and right thoughts, that is to say right moral conduct.

For such a cosmic fight, man enjoys a special position wrt every other creature because he has been given the right to choose. But he needs to reach maturity in order to fight the adversary ahriman is.

The goal of such a struggle is the complete and total renewal of existence, not only eschatologically, but also idealistically and also to the present materialistic world which we must be strive to arrive at with most ashavans.

Zarthustra gave an ontological and idealistic solution to the problem of evil already discussed and expects us ti directly engage with it (ahriman), heads on armed with righteous moral conduct (all idealistic interpretations), the fight being the most important.",/r/Zoroastrianism/comments/sf7idt/the_problem_of_theodicy/huwpkg5/

huwpxoi,HotspurJr,2022-01-30 13:56:36,"&gt; Blake Griffin has had a better career than Iguodala without question. So they'd be correct in saying that.

Has he? 

In retrospect, Blake's best teams were as much about Chris Paul as him. Neither Blake for Iggy accomplished anything of note as the #1 guy on a team. Blake came closer to an MVP (was a top five player in the league one year). Iguodala won a finals MVP. 

Before he was with the Warriors, Iguodala made the second round as arguably the best player, next best players on the team were Jrue Holiday and Elton Brand. 

Best Blake ever did was the second round, as arguably the best player, next best players were Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan.

EVERYBODY takes CP3 and DaJ over Jrue and Brand. 

So at that point - the end of Iguodala's Philly tenure, the end of Blake's Clippers tenure, it's close. You want to give it to Blake, I won't argue, but the notion that it's a no-brainer is unreasonably dismissive of what Iguodala did in Philly. 

And then Iguodala has a massive second act ... and Blake doesn't. 

The biggest divide in player evaluation is between what players CAN do and what they actually contribute to winning. Blake is great if you look at the first category and only so-so if you look at the second. Iguodala is great if you look at the second and only so-so if you look at the first.",/r/nba/comments/sgg90k/what_will_be_the_legacy_of_andrew_wiggins/huwpxoi/

You could use that argument for everything though.

Why not have east Asian inspired vampires that use the spirits and bodies of the dead to create monstrous horrors of various folklore. They could recruit or enthral the most elite warriors of the region leading the charge alongside said monsters, and have powerful spellcasters that mix the already established alchemy and other cathayan lores of magic with necromancy in an unholy combination that puts their human contemporaries to shame.

huwt85h,MrMastaofDesasta,2022-01-30 14:17:03,"Having a portable army that you can command without even spending a bonus action does not seem that bad to me. A player in my campaign is a necromancy wizard, and the only reason that he has not completely broken every encounter is that he actively tries not to do that.

Animate dead is pretty basic, but you can get a small force with some frontline zombies and some archer skeletons for the low cost of 2-3 3rd level spellslots.

Having a bunch of low ranking undead on the battlefield might not do much damagewise, but they can provide the help action to other party members or restrain opponents, making necromancers extremely good at crowd control.

Speaking of low ranking, Create Undead lets you create a variety of other kinds of undead, even though they are locked behind lvl 8 spellslots. I admit, that is a bit of a bummer, but Wights which you get with a lvl 8 spellslot can actually create 12 MORE zombies for you, so in addition to the two wights, you can gain 24 additional zombies. With a level 9 slot you could ramp that up to 3 wights and 36 zombies, or you could create two mummies and mummies are just scary.

What, you don't want to spend your spellslots everyday to keep command of your zombies? Finger of Death got you! You can deal massive damage AND any humanoid killed by the spell remains as a zombie under your control indefinitely. With enough time you could take some backwater village hostage and gradually transform them into an army under your command.

While we're talking about the matter of humanoids: All of the above spells only work on boring humanoids, but Negative Energy Flood actually does not specify that. The existence of several Zombie versions of creatures, e.g. Frost Giant Zombies, would imply that any creature can be turned into a Zombie. Granted, that Zombie is not under your control, but in order to turn a battle into a two front war for your enemies, it is enough.

Apart from the spells, there is also the ability (for wizards) where you can assert control over an undead. It is restricted by the intelligence value, but if you use feeblemind beforehand, that is no concern, as is the saving throw. So you could actually gain a deathknight, mummy lord or something like that. It could even work on zombies you created with Negative Energy Flood, so go get that Zombie Dragon!
At lvl 14, if you play your cards right, you could thus one or two dozen low to mid ranking undead under your control, and in addition a single commander like creature with a CR around 15. And still have a good number of spellslots left to cast mighty spells from behind your wall of undying warriors.",/r/dndmemes/comments/sgj41s/i_mean_it_is/huwt85h/

- They care for the well-being of their kingdom (Gwain would have killed Geo,the protagonist of Gwain Saga, with no hesitation because she believe humans are a threat to their kingdom after what another human did before Geo did and Asgore killed six humans child in order to bring hope to the monsters in the underground because they believe they can destroyed the barrier with seven human children souls)

- Their child were save by a science expert (Luna created the Exe-arc for Ami and in exchange she would be exempt from the law after Gwain begged Luna to save Ami and Alphys injected determinations into a golden flower which led to the creation of flowery who was actually Asriel)

- When they fought the silent human protagonist they threw away the option of mercy for certain reason (Gwain was gonna kill Geo because she believed humans were a threat to her kingdom and Asgore didn’t want Frisk to spare him because of he was full of regret for the awful actions he committed)

- The one they love most disagree with their actions, involving humans, which has effected their relationship (Ami saved Geo from being killed Gwain and even intimidated Gwain even after she told that he was a human and Toriel left Asgore after he declared war on humanity)

- They were mentors of a major character, who has strong willfulness and who soon became the strongest member of the team, at one point (Gwain had temporarily trained Geo, who was part of a group of friends called the Gwain Warriors, before his identity was nearly discovered and Asgore had offered to trained Undyne and eventually promoted her to the captain of the royal guards)

&gt; Kaela Mensha Khaine, the
strongest and most warlike of the Aeldari deities, endured
through might.

\- *Codex: Craftworlds (8e)*

The Nightbringer was not the strongest C'tan. 

&gt; Greatest and most terrible of all the C'tan was Mag'ladroth - the font of immortality, the forge of substance, that which was known as the Dragon.

And Khaine vs the Nightbringer was a pretty close fight. 

&gt; From the ground beneath them burst Kaelis Ra, the Nightbringer, and the Eldar fell back for they knew their doom was at hand. With a gesture, Kaelis Ra slew all those near it. With a glance, it condemned the souls of great warriors to an eternity of dust. With a great roar, Khaine levelled his spear and charged.

&gt; Scythe and spear clashed over a mound of corpses in a struggle that tore the skies asunder. Khaine's speed and skill was breathtaking, but the Nightbringer was a being of shadow and the Spear of Khaine could not find its mark. Kaelis Ra let its foe exhaust his rage with the patience of death.

&gt; Without warning, the Nightbringer swung mightily with his scythe, aiming for Khaine's throat. But Khaine had heeded the counsel of the Laughing God well. As the Nightbringer's form became solid to deliver its blow, Khaine lunged, the tip of his spear driving clean through the Yngir's chest.

&gt; Kaelis Ra burst apart in an explosion of silvered shards that nearly cleft Khaine in two as the Yngir's essence tore free of physical form. The silvered warriors around him fell to the earth as the impact spread ever outward, returning to the ground from whence they came. Soon, only Khaine remained, howling his victory.

Mechanically, magic is specialized and each class is good in a specific situation but way below par outside it. Arcanists (wizard class) are generally bad outside of a couple busted spells. Free Nexuses and War Mages are all Warrior-tier in combat. Rectifiers are amazing at healing and stealth. Not quite bio-tier at healing though. Yama Kings are good at social, but can't be the only face so only really work in campaigns with enough social situations to justify two face characters.

&gt;Every world in the Imperium is home to a culture unique to itself, and the people of each world worship the Emperor in a manner informed by its own characteristics.  As each planet and populace was distinctive, so each society took the worship of the Lord of Mankind and made it their own. For the Helio-Cultists of Limnus Epsilon, for example, the Emperor resides in their sun, his warriors coming every century to claim the best of the world's youth to fight at his side within the fiery heart of their star. The forge world Telemachus revered Him as the Great Blacksmith, the Moulder of All Things. To the Apocalites of the worlds bordering the Hell-Stars of the Garon Nebula, he is the bringer of merciful death, deliverance from the evil that stalks their worlds by night. To the feral natives of Miral, the Emperor was the great beast that stalked the dark places of their forests, and to the acid miners of Mordant he is the guiding spirit-light that keeps the all-encompassing darkness at bay.

&gt;The church had learned in the days of the Great Crusade that enforcing its will on worlds by eradicating their belief systems and starting from scratch was a lengthy and troublesome process. Instead, the Ecclesiarchy worked by coercion and change, turning native religions to face Holy Terra and showing them the great truth of the universe – that all gods were the God-Emperor of Man in one guise or another.

Hell, most high level players STILL forget to build anti heal. Imagine low level players...  
Anubis, Aphrodite, Hades, Hel, Zhong... Basically any god that can outheal enemies...

Stealth junglers.

Most beginners don't have the positioning sense to dodge/predict stealth users, or just don't get the mechanic (not noticing the audio cues, for example), so gods like Ao Kuang, The Morrigan  and just abuse them.

&amp;#x200B;

Stance Switchers (all roles have them, so no specific role).

Beginners are starting to grasp on enemy's kits, learning how to respect and punish cooldown (for example, being aggressive on Anubis because his stun is off, and your chances of winning is higher than his). By using stance switchers, you will confuse and gain advantage over them.  
(Hel, Artio, Merlin, Tiamat, Tyr, Ullr so on) (they are kinda difficult mechanically, but after 2 or 3 days playing them in a row, you ending up getting the combos / strats with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Blink or Die Guardians.

Just like most beginners don't know how to counter cc with good positioning, they don't know how to use beads appropriately, so Guardians (that are basically walking walls with unreasonable CC) can be fairly strong (gods like Ares, Athena, Ymir)

&amp;#x200B;

Bruiser Warriors.

You are defending 4 hours of watered down work based on what? Because I have balls and will not let people save face, confronting them with the logic of the situation instead of ""flowing"" with people's feelings and ego. For what benefit? What do I get out of it? What does ANYONE get out of it?

You can be mad all day and all year for decades. It won't change my mind and you won't explain how and why you're mad that I'm calling out people in international promotions working out for a somewhat watered down 2 - 4 hours. There are 15 hours in the day, and I'm not sure what the fucking goalpost I moved is. Tell me how someone can't put in an hour of fight specific work when they're putting in 2 - 4 hours on other shit and getting paid for it.

I don't get trapped in emotional social politics. Recognize that what is ""a lot"" is relative. Humanity could degenerate to obese lazier people or to ultra fit warriors or some shit; who cares though. In today's day and age, on Earth, people are putting in 2 - 4 hours of physical work and becoming pros. The work isn't close to 100% like sprinting or backlifting a 1 rep max or deadlifting a 1 rep max. It's moderate work and they don't even do it every day. They refuse to do simple conditioning or any kind of physical work the other 13 - 11 hours of the day.

How are you personally affected by this. .. lense? Will you have to admit that you're a lazy noob in whatever field you're in by this standard? Are you angry about the 9 hours you have to put in at work and don't want to be told a greater time and effort investment is required to reach a higher level?

 Is the standard too brutal for you to ever live up to? Just walk for 4+ hours on top of whatever you do and start adding wearable weights, bear walking, and crab walking to start. It's simple and easy. You can add an hour+ of heavy bag power shots with a stance switch every strike. That's 7 hours. I assume you have a job though so replace some of the walking as need be.

You'll never work up to that low level of training though. You'll never put in a high intensity 4 hours daily either, as in VERY high intensity 4 hours without breaks. 

And why is that?

huwz610,PortoGuy18,2022-01-30 14:54:23,"Eren wasn't acting, he was pissd because what Frieda and Zeke said goes against who he is as a person.

Eren has a sense of justice that was molded by the ideologies that he has since his birth, such as ""Because i was born to this world"", which leads to him rejecting Zke's plan of euthanization since to him being born is one of the greatest gifts in life.

He also rejects the Vow of Renouncing War from the Reiss family since he is against dying like cattle, which is exactly what Frieda is proposing.

This isn't about Paradis, this is about Eren and the type of person that he is while projecting his sense of justice into those who are suffering from injustice, which is why he also saved Ramzi from being beaten up by those 3 guys in chapter 131.

Not once during chapter 120 and 121 do we see Eren actually say that he is doing this for Paradis, not even in his talk with Reiner back in the declaration of war.

Eren wasn't acting in these moments, this was genuine anger towards those who go against his core character traits and his drive for freedom.

But the thing is that once Eren got god-like power (Founder) that grants him the chance to indulge in his darkest and most selfish desires/fantasies (The Rumbling) and he allowed that to be his main concern and drag along everything and everyone in his path, to the point of him being just another problematic and hypocritical bastard just like everyone else before him.

Once he started The Rumbling, Eren killed countless Paradisians and allowed the Warriors and his friends to kill countless more without even trying to stop it.

But just because Eren wanted to reach That Scenery in chapter 131, that doesn't mean that he wouldn't be able to fully digest the massacre that he is responsible for, so the guilt and pressure of the omnicide get to him and he loses willpower and never heal beyond his head throughout the entire final arc.

Although it's in his nature to keep moving forward towards his freedom, deep down Eren wants to be stopped because he can't handle the guilt, so he allows The Alliance to put an end to both the world's suffering and his own.",/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/sgl0ad/can_someone_explain_to_me_how_erens_actions_make/huwz610/

Li Dao the Fire Dragon, who rules over the Southern Provinces including the Mountains of Heaven, has tried to capture the Monkey King. However, he has been forced to call upon the Monkey Warriors to defend the southern borders of Cathay against the Kings of Ind and the Nagas of Kuresh in the past, much to the Monkey King's amusement. This situation has led the Dragons to reluctantly allow the Monkey King to continue his rule over the mountains, rather than risk the border falling to the Indans or the vile Snakemen.”

huwzwbt,PortoGuy18,2022-01-30 14:59:14,"Eren wasn't acting, he was pissed because what Frieda and Zeke said goes against who he is as a person.  
  
Eren has a sense of justice that was molded by the ideologies that he has since his birth, such as ""Because i was born to this world"", which leads to him rejecting Zke's plan of euthanization since to him being born is one of the greatest gifts in life.  
  
He also rejects the Vow of Renouncing War from the Reiss family since he is against dying like cattle, which is exactly what Frieda is proposing.  
  
This isn't about Paradis, this is about Eren and the type of person that he is while projecting his sense of justice into those who are suffering from injustice, which is why he also saved Ramzi from being beaten up by those 3 guys in chapter 131 even though he will kill him in the future during his pursuit of The Scenery.  
  
Not once during chapter 120 and 121 do we see Eren actually say that he is doing this for Paradis, not even in his talk with Reiner back in the declaration of war.  
  
Eren wasn't acting in these moments, this was genuine anger towards those who go against his core character traits and his drive for freedom.  
  
But the thing is that once Eren got god-like power (Founder) that grants him the chance to indulge in his darkest and most selfish desires/fantasies (The Rumbling) and he allowed that to be his main concern and drag along everything and everyone in his path, to the point of him being just another problematic, idiotic, hypocritical self-centered selfish bastard just like everyone else before him.  
  
Once he started The Rumbling, Eren killed countless Paradisians and allowed the Warriors and his friends to kill countless more without even trying to stop it.  
  
But just because Eren wanted to reach That Scenery in chapter 131, that doesn't mean that he wouldn't be able to fully digest the massacre that he is responsible for, so the guilt and pressure of the omnicide get to him and he loses willpower and never heal beyond his head throughout the entire final arc.  
  
Although it's in his nature to keep moving forward towards his freedom, deep down Eren wants to be stopped because he can't handle the guilt, so he allows The Alliance to put an end to both the world's suffering and his own and it just so happens that the specific way he would die would end the curse.",/r/titanfolk/comments/sgk6ep/he_deserves_an_oscar_for_this_performance/huwzwbt/

hux0ctg,KasumiR,2022-01-30 15:02:10,"Hmm, Diablo 2's second city kinda fits. It has scarabs, locust swarms, cat-warriors and stuff, Lut Gholein is not actual Egypt, but pretty close, but you probably know that if you played Titan Quest (if not, it's a must play).

Not actual RPG, but several Tomb Raider games focus on Egypt, the one set entirely there and having tons of mythology elements in The Last Revelation on PC (Steam possible) and PS1 (emulate in Duckstation). It's VERY good. It's more action-adventure, but out of all original TR games 4: TLR is the most RPG-ish one with combining items and traveling between levels in quasi-open-world. First Tomb Raider has a bunch of Egyptian levels too, and the remake, Anniversary, follows on that. Classic. However, Last Revelation is where it's at with mythological creatures, pyramids and dungeons.

There were also games made base on the Mummy films with Brendan Fraser, they weren't very good and aged like most PS1 era third person adventures but hey, you fight scorpions and mummies there.

There's surprisingly few RPGs with Egyptian setting TBH, however there's a bunch of strategy games, if you're interested, Pharaoh+Cleopatra and Hexus are competent city builders... I've also seen Warriors of the Nile on Steam that looked like Final Fantasy Tactics but Egyptian chibi style. Never played it myself. And of course, there's Age of Mythology. But again, strategies are a different genre.

Oh, if you don't mind RPG-boomer-shooter-hybrid, there was a game called Exhumed (Powerslave), which played like other RPG-like Doom era shooters, i.e. Heretic or Hexen, like it has first person shooter gameplay but with skills, spells, open levels and progression like in actual RPG.

Other people recommended Assassin's Creed Origins already, you actually explore mythology in it a lot and take part in some religious rituals, one of which leads to fighting a magic snake, you also explore REAL pyramid and tomb layouts, which is fantastic, but yeah you don't get to fight mummies until the second DLC, Curse of the Pharaohs. It's a great game but takes a while to get to the cooler stuff. My recommendation for it would be to play normally until story gets you to Alexandria (where you get main abilities) then go around and see pyramids and crap, for enemies to not be spongy you need to upgrade weapons or just find areas at low enough level.

I need to save this thread to see if anyone found any other games coz am interested myself, here's a thread from 2 years ago with some answers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg\_gamers/comments/dn6ei1/anybody\_know\_of\_any\_rpg\_with\_a\_egyptian\_setting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/dn6ei1/anybody_know_of_any_rpg_with_a_egyptian_setting/)",/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/sgho95/any_ps4_and_or_pc_rpg_where_the_game_takes_place/hux0ctg/

the momentum shift in game 5 onward was astoundingly entertaining. before that though, Cavs looked like they didn’t have a chance. i think everyone going into the series agreed that despite the Cavs having the best player on the planet, Golden State was a far superior team, and it looked so as the Cavs got their ass handed to them by the Warriors depth in the first two games. but then they clapped the Warriors in game 3 which was totally unpredicted, but then momentum swung back as they failed to close out game 4 at home going down 3-1 after Steph put on a masterclass in game 4. at that point, i’m pretty sure majority thought Cavs were done for, albeit draymond’s suspension, because they were still gonna have to go back to Oakland and battle a deep ass warriors team.

For Eren, the just the fact of being born is already one of the greatest gits in life and Zeke and Ymir were going to put a stop to that, so he went against it because that is the type of person he is.

He also killed 3 adult men just in order to save a little girl (Mikasa) that he didn't even know, because that is who he is and he projects his sense of justice into those who are suffering from injustice. Whether they are eldians or not, it's irrelevant which is why he also saved Ramzi even though he knew he would kill him in the future in his chase for freedom.

You can't say that Eren is doing this for the children of Paradis and that natalism = Paradis when we have Eren be responsible for the deaths of the Reiss children and the children that he killed in 125.

Those kids died because they were in the way of Eren's selfish and dark fanatsies (rummbling) and not becaus they were a sacrifice to save Paradis.

Eren manipulated everyone around him and even allowed the yeagerists that believed in him to die pointless deaths at the hands of the Warriors just so that he could reach The Scenery in 131.",/r/titanfolk/comments/sgkv0t/hes_only_in_despair_cause_its_against_his/hux4el2/

hux5cer,Judgejia,2022-01-30 15:31:42,"I would assume you would want to know a more holistic analysis of each species' capabilities then, one that accounts mainly for their physiology, psychology, culture, and anthropology (or whatever it is for an alien).  

Humanity: 6/10 ground, 10/10 space. Humanity is all around solid ground forces, well rounded but nothing particularly special unlike most of the Covenant species. In space, humanity would dominate given their immense experience fighting more powerful and numerous foes. The tactics developed allowed them to drag out an unwinnable war decades long. 

Sangheili: 9/10 ground, 8/10 space. Sangheili are like humans, but better in most meaningful ways. A warrior culture from birth, stronger and swifter, they're well rounded warriors that can serve a multitude of positions. In space, they're very capable tacticians as well, although I wouldn't consider them quite as good as human ones. They also have a bit of a tendency to not work as cohesively when it comes to fighter squadrons, due to their culture's obsession with honor. If anything, their entire culture is held back by their honor, yet it defines who they are as a species. 

Jiralhanae: 9/10 ground, 5/10 space. Jiralhanae are quite similar to the Sangheili, less swift and agile but made up by being stronger and tougher. On the ground, they're incredibly ferocious warriors, and quite forceful, utilitarian, and pragmatic. In space, that's less so; perhaps we can blame their losses at the Ark as a lack of experience, but both times, they're facing inferior forces and still being devastated. We haven't seen too many other instances of Jiralhanae space capabilities, but their aggressive nature would probably hinder their tactics considerably. 

I'm too lazy to explain the rest of the species, but those three are the big players IMO when it comes to the species of Halo. I'm just spitballing but I'd say Jackals are 6/10 ground, 7/10 space, Grunts are 8/10 ground, ?/10 space (dunno any grunt space combat history, but would be very low), Hunters are 10/10 ground, ?/10 (same as grunts), Drones are 7/10 ground, ?/10 space, Prophets (if they're Stoics and not genetically crippled reformists) are 3/10 ground, 7/10 space.",/r/HaloStory/comments/sghkdp/on_a_scale_of_110_if_each_currently_active_alien/hux5cer/

hux8iw3,asmallauthor1996,2022-01-30 15:52:17,"It'll take awhile and won't be pretty for anyone in Legion territory but the Legion will fall when Caesar dies. But I think that the Legion's fall will mainly come from a civil war between the strongest Legates such as Lanius and Frumentarii like Vulpes with some Praetorians like Lucius all leading various factions/groups of the Legion with their own goals in mind. Some of the more bloodthirsty leaders such as Lanius will just go on an all-out, self-destructive warpath against anything and everything in their way regardless of whether it's tactically advantageous to do so. Vulpes' means of ruling through fear and punishing profligates will only get him so far, especially since it seems likely that he'll turn on those in Legion territory for shits and giggles. Lucius may be the most sensible of them all in that he's the leader of the Praetorians and would muster the best warriors in the Legion to his cause, but being a wartime commander doesn't equal ruling a nation.



The Legion will also suffer from its territories slowly rising against their oppressors once news of Caesar's death comes to them. Various cultures and identities that were unique to numerous Tribes and Gangs were wiped away by the Legion in place of Nova Roma. This would obviously breed an incredible level of resentment against the Legion, Caesar, his Legates, and anyone that even remotely supports them due to wiping away everything that these numerous factions had as their own. Something we can already see happening due to Antony being sickened about his tribe, the Hangdogs, having their hounds slaughtered and absorbed into the Legion with nothing of the Hangdogs' heritage remaining. Ulysses also points this out in that he saw the Twisted Hairs' disappearing as a culture once they were the first Tribe to be coopted into the Legion with Joshua Graham supporting this. We'll also see this happen to the Khans, Ormetas, Fiends, Boomers, Kings, and various other groups that were enslaved and/or conquered by the Legion in New Vegas. What few ""civilized"" Tribes that manage to survive in Legion territory and aren't destroyed still have their unique ways crushed and oppressed, this resentment most likely going to boil over into widespread insurrection at some point.



Moreover, it doesn't seem like Caesar imparted any of his knowledge on subjects such as statesmanship or sociology while creating a society that celebrates anti-intellectualism. With only one person having the proper know-how of creating and leading a nation even somewhat competently (and this is a BIG stretch in Caesar's case), them dying is one of the biggest nails in the coffin for this faction. Caesar never seemed to bother training any sort of heir or type of pupil so that someone could at least preserve the ideas of the Legion is he's dead or indisposed. This doesn't really have much of an impact in gameplay or the Second Battle of Hoover Dam due to your average Legionnaire being a fucking illiterate fanatic with no knowledge of anything beyond ""hit/shoot this until it's dead in the name of Caesar."" But the long-term impact is that Caesar's death means that the one person who can hold the Legion together through a combination of fear, charisma, fanaticism, enslavement, and outright zealotry being dead means that things won't look good. The Legion will slowly splinter apart even IF they win the Second Battle of the Hoover Dam due to a combination of incompetence and internal factionalism that will see Caesar's original ideas being twisted and distorted by anyone who attempts to take his place. Not to mention the lack of knowledge that even the most educated-ish people in the Legion like Lanius lack when it comes to leading a nation, motivating soldiers, governing a population, etc.",/r/Fallout/comments/sdom8j/do_you_think_the_legion_will_fall_with_caesars/hux8iw3/

We know that CA said ""Stop talking about Araby"" last year and they seemed actively angry about it, but that may just be due to people not shutting up about it. But Araby coming is highly dependent on Games Workshop.

As of right now GW has a few things that they need to consider. They need to come up with new models/units for Grand Cathay and Kislev to sell more DLC lord packs. 

They need to consider if they're going to create new daemons for some of the daemon rosters that are pretty slim, but also mostly complete. Do they introduce new daemon models and variants? Age of Sigmar variants? More mortals? What about the Chaos Warriors and Beastmen? What about Norsca and the Undivided Chaos Daemon faction?

Then they need to figure out what they're going to do about Bretonnia. It's part of The Old World reboot of Warhammer Fantasy, so this is a prime opportunity to flesh out their roster. (They may also add something to The Empire, Dwarfs, and Vampire Counts considering they're also part of The Old World).

Then we have to worry about Ogre Kingdoms DLC, as they're missing some high profit units. The Chaos Dwarfs are coming, so that's going to be huge.

After that, what? Ind? Nippon? Khuresh? None of those have army books. Araby doesn't have an army book. Well, if they do, they're nowhere near on the state of 8th edition and would highly depend on if GW wants to work on them to flesh them out, rework them, make them more unique, etc.

So there are a *lot* of unknowns. There's potential for them to do things, but right now we just have no information. We'll definitely know more when the Combined Campaign Map for WHIII releases. If it has room for Ind, Khuresh and Nippon, then we might get those factions. If they're not on the map, then we'll never get them. And if we don't get them, then there's a very tiny chance that we might get Araby instead, but it's honestly still unlikely due to how long it'd likely take GW to work on their roster.",/r/totalwar/comments/sgh51h/small_ind_monkey_king_and_khuresh_mention_in/hux9g49/

Ancient Greece and moreover ancient Macedonia produced great prolific artwork for the dead,  usually by the wives of the dead.  Alexander's 3 wives however were all Persian,  so that custom would not have been followed. 

At a time also that Northern and Eastern European and Western Asia practiced almost exclusively pyres for warriors and Alexander was technically a warrior. But back to the wives,  Ancient Persian tradition would've been to place the body in a stone ""crucible"", covered with a stone top and sealed.  That's unlikely only because Alexander was in Babylon, which if it still existed would be in Iraq. His body was not returned to the wives or Greece,  so that increases the likelihood he was given a warrior's burial by fire.

Warriors of Chaos   but seeing as they have already seemingly abandoned horde factions I think most of the Warriors of Chaos issues' will likely be addressed in WH3 whenever they get around to marrying the Chaos factions in base game WH3 with the stuff from WH1/2

S.E.S  - I'm your girl - first kpop girl group really great mix of R&amp;B, pop and ballads, vocals on point.

Park Ji Yoon - coming of age ceremony. Everone knows the title track, but the entire album is really good and pretty much sold me on her talent.

BoA - Valenti (its Japanese realease but... its Boa) either dancing or crying, genuinely good album.

SNSD (Girls Generation) - Oh! - has oh, gee and genie.  Like literally pop perfection.

Shinee - 1 of 1/1 and 1 - much has been said, it's great mix of great dance songs and great crying songs.

Kai - Kai the first mini album - literally no skips, distilled the best of dance R&amp;B and got an album which only flaw is being too short. Also represents the fact that exo really has great ballads and dance tracks, overall great solo discography. Easily could have been Baeks solo work.

Gfriend - time for us - distilled cute and youthful gg concept. Also similar vibes to SES so the world only moved so far, but its because it was good.

Brown eyed girls - BEST(yes its compilation album but its all bangers soo) - hot music for hot people. literally bangers and for me shows the sensual concept at its best. 

TVXQ! - tri-angle. the first few songs are balland and then you get to title track.

&gt;Beautiful. Deadly. Destined for greatness.
&gt;
&gt;In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, Celaena, an assassin, is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom.

Here's a couple references from various traditions that kinda point to what I'm saying. They're all just copy pasted so sorry in advance for the shitty formatting :)


The Hopi tradition describes the gathering of 144,000 “rainbow warriors” or “sundancers” who will unite the earth. At that time, people will have their choice to accept or reject the Creator’s plan for peace on earth. This is prophetically seen as the return of Quetzacoatl who in the ancient Mayan tradition is also the God of the planet Venus.


In the Gospel of Barnabas, chapter 17, it is written: “144000 prophets that God sent to the world, have spoken obscurely; but after me will come the splendor of all prophets and saint; he will illuminate the darkness of whole what have told the prophets, because it is the messenger of God”



The Christian Skoptsy sect in Russia believed that the Messiah would come when there were 144,000 Skoptsy believers, based on their reading of the Book of Revelation.


Also there's a passage in the Nag Hammadi codices that refers to the 144k in this same manner, however my book isn't near me so I'm having trouble sifting through the dense text to find it. But. It's there :) Theosophy also portrays the 144k in nearly an identical manner to the Mayan traditions.",/r/Psychonaut/comments/sfvpwn/telepathy_on_psychedelics/huxbds9/

Not only was Hashirama an extremely powerful and ingenius shinobi, the likes of whom hadn't been seen in a very long time, he had an OP skill that couldn't be replicated naturally. That didn't mean that the other Senju were useless. The other Senju were still pretty OP, next to the normal shinobi.

Similarly, the Gojo clan could have elite warriors who don't use the Limitless or who've adopted less powerful variations. Maybe they don't use Limitless at all and have an extremely large supply of cursed energy which they employ in other techniques.

Yes you can be attacked by melee attacks while on the ground. But that is not a weakness of flight. Anyone on the ground can already be attacked in melee. The difference with a flyer however is they can choose to fly outside of melee range, effectively gaining immunity to melee attacks. 

Not to mention flying warriors using reach weapons. They can fly 10 feet above ground to attack any medium sized foe without ever worrying about melee retaliation.

Having seen a polearm wielding aarakorca barbarian in action, I can assure you that flight has huge advantages in combat by simply allowing for increased mobility, the ability to mostly ignore terrain, they ability to get past enemy front lines, and the ability to become effectively immune to melee attacks whenever they choose.

But I would stipulate that she is *not* right. Not even within the story. The ignorance of the royal family trying to cast the sins onto the Eldian people, forcing them to die for their idea of peace, is exactly what precipitated this event in the first place. Grisha didn’t start this story, *they* started this story. This, WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, is the result of all their scheming. They caused this.

Also, you’re completely wrong about Paradis existing to quell the rage of the world. They unite to take down Paradis, but that is *all* they unite on. As you say, there are still wars, but I think you’re understating it. Marley has been at war with other countries *this entire time*, right up until they sign the treaty after the battle we see at the start of season 4. As the warriors were starting their incursion into Paradis, Marley had Zeke off using his voice to use pure titans to attack another nation. It’s like WW2. The US and USSR were coordinating to take down Nazi Germany, but they still hated each other and as soon as the Nazis were defeated the Cold War happened. Casting hatred upon the people of Paradis for a unity that doesn’t even actually bring about peace is a stupendously cruel and shortsighted position.

Finally, what happens to your peace when Paradis is destroyed? It’s gone. You implied the King who renounced war thought the threat of the rumbling would be enough to keep people away. But as narrated by Tybur, it was always the plan that the world would eventually invade and kill everyone on Paradis.

huxdjam,draugotO,2022-01-30 16:25:38,"Back in the time of Sundering (when werewolves separated the mortal and spirit realm) a shaman made a pact with the original Stryx in one of the many Caerns of that time, allowing the spirit to posses him, permanently, while he would regain access to the longevity and ""numinas"" (spiritual powers) he had before the sundering, and those was made the first vampire, a Host of owl spirits according to werewolves.

Each time the vampire Embraced someone, the Stryx, would fragment itself and pass ""the beast"" forward, raising the new undead at the cost of a dot of Blood Potency. These fragments instinctively seek to be whole again, hence the need for a Tradition against the Diablerie.

The human half of the original vampire eventually learned of it's spirit counterparr ill intentions against humanity. Sure, the shaman accepted to pay a regular tribute of human blood to appease the Beast, but it had never agreed with what he later learned to be the true intentions of the Stryx... And to stop the horrors to come, he sacrificed himself, banishing the stryx within back to the spirit realm.

the Stryx was too fragmented when it was banished to the spirit realm to stay whole, and as such the original spirit is no more, rather the hordes of Stryx are it's fragments, all of them containing part of it's original mind, but none capable of absorbing it's brethearen to make itself whole again... Not as long as parts of it remain anchored in the mortal realm.

The Stryx see vampires as treachorous tools, rightifully theirs but untrustworthy to fulfill the plan... A plan which no stryx remember entirely. The owls seek to destroy enough vampires that they can subsume in the spirit world and remember what their plan was when forming the first kindread... And then force their human hosts to fulfill their part of the bargain.

Due to the separation between the mortal and spirit realms though, Stryx cannot manifest freely, and kindread normally living in cities rarely come around caerns strong enough to allow the parliment of owls to collect it's due... However, each and every vampire is a host for a fragment of the Stryx, and a potential conduit for other of it's kind. Whenever a vampire falls low enough in humanity, he starts frailing the veil around him. The first manifestations are subtle, a sensation if being watched, while weird phenomena manifest itself around the kindread from times to times. As the downward spiral continues, the weird phenomena increase in frequency, but most notably of all, the kindread start *seen* the Stryx of the spiritual world around him... Just as they see him. If the vampire don't take this final warning to correct his way, if he insists on depravity, he eventually allows for Stryx to more directly affect the world around him, firstly by possessing carcasses left behind, but eventually even attacking the kindread directly if he falls low enough... Only if a vampire trully loses himself, if he allows ""the Beast"" to take over, will the owls leave him alone, for once the Human is gone, the Stryx fragment, that many erroneously think a un-wit beast, will take over the body and force it to fulfill it's part of the ancient bargain.

Diablerie is even more feared among those with high ranks of Occuktism for they know that absorbing the beasts of others strengthen the Stryx within (consider that the ""stryx rank"" of the Beast increases each time the vampire diablerizes someone. Make it so it is ever harder to resist the frenzy and the longer it lasts. Strong enough ""beasts"" could attemp to force frenzies even without provocation, and the most powerful of them may even drop any pretense of irrationality and cleverly force it's vampiric host to fulfill it's duty when ""frenzing"". Think how most movies depict Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hide, with the vampire thinking himself a proper member of society just for a sudden frenzy to occur when noone is looking and the Stryx driving it's carcass around.



#Potential plots:#

The Lancea et Sanctum is accusing the Circle of the Crone to be a Stryx worshipping cult, that saved themselves from the Stryx attention against kindreads of low humanity by offering to infiltrate and sacrifice each other kindread in the world. The Circle of the Crone accuses the Lancea of propaganda to erradicate them ""because they know their lies and tricks cannot compsre to the true powers of the Crone"". The Set: both sects will dispute influence over other sects in am alliances-race.it is obvious to all that trouble is brewing, some will attempt tk flee the cjty, others to apaziguate the situation and the clever ones to consolidate their domains. The Actors: if the players are small fires, they may see the situation as either an opportunity to carve a part of the city for themselves under the guise of the increasing hostilities and ever more open attacks between kindreads, or they may wish to consolidate whatever they have and see where the wind will blow. If they are kindread of some influence, they may be a key piece on the war to come, oreven adefinig factor as to where their sect willlean to. Trully powerful characters may even attempt to broke alliances of their own with other sects. Climax: all this building up hostility eventually blows up when a way too daring attack causes an all out war among the Family. As the war rages on, either the Lancea or the Circle will fall, and it's allies are unlikely to fare any better. Consequences: depending in rather the Storyteller decide if the Lancea's acusation had aby truth behind it and on who won the war, the next story can be anything from cleaning up the mess of the war, covering up Masquerade breaches, dealing with Hunters that showed up because of the turnmoil etc to a desperate attempt to stop whatever the Stryx are planning to do.;

Someone have being commiting way to many diableries... Worse yet, they have found a way to hide it. It doesn't take long for the Family to realize there is an imposter among them, someone that will look like just any other Kindread at first glance, but that is trully driven by a Stryx, not a human mind. This scenario is sponencislly better if your players like to play Among Us. Decide before the game start if the players will all be kindread trying to out the Stryx, or if you will draw/draft the Stryx from among them, but don't lie. Player that think there is a Stryx among them will create tension with each other, and if this tension is not justified, the game may well degrade into fights... On the other hand, a player that thinks he is playing a kindread just to find out, one game, that he was the Stryx all along as the Storyteller take control of his character will not be amused with the development. So be sure to tell before the game start if there will be a Stryx among the players or not;

A coterie comes together to unrevel the truth behind the Stryx, not only what they are and why they seen to hate vpires, but eventually what was the plan that the original Stryx had. This game works better with a travelling coterie, use it to explore not only different mystical places, but also other supernstural creatures, such as werewolves and mages, that can interact more directly with spirits;

A werewolf pack have being openly hunting kindread in the region. The elder decide this is enough of a threat for them to make a move, but they can't act on the dark. Information is key, and they draft a coterie of occultists, investogators, warriors and may be even diplomats obtain information on the werewolves. Eventually they come about the information that this entire pack belong to a Tribe know for hunting Hosts, mortals possessed by spirits... Why are these Host hunters targetting vampires? Do the Family know they are all Stryx hosts? If not, how do they react to the revelation? If they did, does that change how the elders will attempt to deal with the situation?",/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/sgk47t/does_anyone_have_interesting_stryx_homebrew/huxdjam/

Secondly, almost all of them have different styles of fighting. This is depicted in Oberyn vs Gregor very well.

huxe6dk,flyer_higher,2022-01-30 16:29:56,"I'm happy you like them. I am now determined to finish this list, even if I'm the only one to fill it up. 

58. Argedir's Circuit, a nickname for a track of minor streets and alleys for cart racing organized by a local minor crime boss who particularly enjoys the sport. His gangs and bribes ensure the streets are clear in time for the races and all sorts of people bet on victors, including officials who turn an otherwise blind eye. All are allowed to ride, but there is a fee to compete. Augmentation or interference with horse, rider or cart is entirely illegal and can result in maiming or death. The track is named so after a drunken man called Argedir who rode down crowded streets in an effort to win his own race (he was the only competitor). 

59. The Elenur Glens. Only a half-mile outside the city, the mystical Elenur glens are avoided entirely by the people of the city other than risk-takers who were sent on a dare or men of honor who were challenged to stay there for a night. It has been left well alone for many lives of men as there are strange, mad faeries who dwell there, torn from the Feywild and unable to return. They take prisoner any intruders who are spotted within their lands--any who have escaped fled the city in terror, never to return. Its reputation is so terrifying that its name is hardly spoken above a whisper, for fear of summoning its residents. Every few years, however, the bravest (mostly foreign) men gather their supplies and march out into the darkness in an attempt to conquer the woods. Few, if any, return.

60. The Tombs of Dero'lar, the catacombs where the elders of a now fallen and disgraced house of nobles are buried in the darkness. The law-required watch over the entrance is now little more than a position for recruits or a vacation for veterans, and grave-robbers and beggars have taken full advantage of this over the years. Parties of vagabonds and thieves still pick through the searched graves looking for anything they can sell on the black market. Despite the long years, not all secrets have been uncovered... right?

61. Lightcrest Hill, the point where the sun first rises over the city. A great marble statue of a knight holding his great sword up towards the sky, untouchable by any hammer or winds of time, has stood unmoving since the city was built. It is a holy site of gods of the Light Domain, and the finest flowers and ore are found around and in the hill. Religious ceremonies are often performed on and around the wide hilltop, with the statue ('Sir Ercanagel') serving as a witness. Pilgrims also make the three-quarter-mile journey to the hill when they beg something of their god.   

62. The Halls of the Nightriders, the home of the Knight-lords who ride to the call of the horns of the north where their kin dwell. It is often empty or close to it, whether from the long roads or the battles at the end of them. Those who do remain, however, are ever watchful and welcome those who will swear their oaths and take up arms when their Lord calls them, and others they bade listen to the songs of their long-ago deeds. Those few who do remain are mostly minstrels or men too young, old, or injured to fight. They are honorable and lordly, but what family doesn't have its dark secrets?

63. The Wishfont, an attraction for those weary travelers who feel luck is on their side. In the middle of a square in a well-to-do district sits a 6' diameter marble fountain filled with coins. Anyone who passes by has the urge to throw in a coin. The local legend of the poor boy who threw in his last gold piece and was laden with good fortune the next day (being taken in by a Lord and becoming a Knight years later) is rampant across the town. In reality, the Wishfont is enchanted by a powerful trickster wizard and the only magical property it holds is its magical aura and the urge. It is taboo to collect the coin you have thrown in, with people citing the case of a wealthy 'copperpincher' who was waylaid by bandits a few days later. 

64. The Gate of Kings, the wide stone bridge leading to the main gates of the city. The Gate refers to the ovacular 70' high gap underneath where the water runs through. It is called such because when the rightful King/Lord returned to the city after he was exiled by traitorous family/allies, he sailed his army in darkness under the bridge and landed on the shore to enter the city in a more secretive way. Now it is a sacred place and important decisions are made there, with the hope of guidance in spirit from the long-ago King whose wisdom brought him victory.

65. The Endless Flagon, the hotspot tavern where most of the lower-class gambling is done in the city. With experienced guards and unflinching dealers, it is widely regarded as a trustworthy establishment that abides by the law. If one knows how and where to look, however, the dark side of the tavern is unveiled: a black market with the most despicable men in the city as clients. Anything or anyone can be bought there, even the most incorruptible nobles and officials.

66. Guildpoint, the square at the heart of the guild-dominated districts of the city. Carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, and the like operate in and around the large square in different halls and houses. If one needs stone to be carved or gold to be fashioned, Guildpoint is the place to hire.  

67. Starshield Estate, a walled manor house and its small surrounding areas. The lord is a revered warrior within the city and being in his service brings great renown. It commonly hosts tournaments and squires young men and boys under the lord and his men's tutelage. The gates are always open and warriors from across the realm are allowed to train and do battle, with clerics ready to heal the injured. It goes without being said that bitter rivalries have been brought about from this practice...",/r/d100/comments/se7pnv/d100_interesting_rpable_locations_in_a_fantasy/huxe6dk/
huxe8d5,Snowlio,2022-01-30 16:30:18,"Disclaimer, I am a noob, but I have saved a ton of info from other posts and codex reveiws and bat reps so heres my best guesses. 
Honestly looks really solid. Normal fore warriors won't be bad here, but more kroot could help solve issues, too early to tell but definitely don't sleep on the pulse rifles ability to harass. If you find you need more stopping power or speed add a ghostkeel as many seem to like those. Riptides are tanky and pretty good problem solvers. Maybe loose the krootox and lower how many crisis you use to fit in other things. But mileage will vary, if the krootox do work keep em in. 
Also maybe try bork'an if you struggle with breacher range, it does a lot for them. Loosing farsight is sad but your enforcer is already a diet farsight and all mont'ka lists will be as aggressive as old farsight lists. (Do add more marker drones or pathfinders if going bork'an) 
Also potentially worth looking at is custom septs can be related to a sept, having its warlord trait. So you could have a custom farsight sept that looses x2 warlords and farsight access, but you can add ethereals and have fun with their invocation of stone making your crissis very hard to shift.",/r/Tau40K/comments/sgm7gp/was_wondering_what_to_really_add_to_this_9th/huxe8d5/

huxffeb,Pseudonym-Dom,2022-01-30 16:38:09,"There's quite a few things that I'd love to see covered, or at least just hear your opinion in a comment since most of these wouldn't really warrant a video or anything.

* Legend made a comment a while ago about Tzeentch &gt; Nurgle &gt; Khorne &gt; Slaanesh &gt; Tzeentch, which was some interesting insight. But what about matchups like Nurgle vs. Slaanesh, and Khorne Vs. Tzeentch? Who counters who in those and why? Does nurgle just out trade slaanesh, or does slaanesh cycle charge him all day? Does khorne shrug off the magic of tzeentch, or does tzeentch melt khorne from ranged since he's not as fast as slaanesh to close the distance and not as tanky as nurgle on the approach?
* Regarding the previous point, Legend was clearly looking at that from a campaign perspective. Regarding multiplayer, I'd love to see if those hold true or if it's changed up due to the nature of MP being so different. And if it is different, which actually counters what?
* When playing against something that supposedly counters you, I'd love to see what strategy to employ and what kind of units you should be using in those matchups. Obviously Nurgle's going to need to rely on his more mobile units against Tzeentch, but what about all of the other matchups?
* Similar again to the previous two, but what about other matchups involving ogres, cathay, kislev, etc. Not just against each other, but against the Chaos factions as well.
* Legend had some videos of ""never recruit these units"" or ""always recruit these units"". Would love to see your thoughts on which game 3 units are under/over performing or just particularly good/bad and should be more often than not used or avoided. Obviously the answer would be different depending on campaign or multiplayer, but any insight is great.
* When it comes to shared units like Forsaken, Chaos Furies, Chaos Spawn, etc. I'd love to get your opinion on which god has the best and worst of each type, and which gods you should bother using or avoiding each unit with.
* You're already going to do Slaanesh next week, but just want to state how excited I am to see you cover the Slaanesh mechanics. Especially the vassals, stealing units, etc. As a side note, would love you cover how vassals work in game 3 at the same time you cover slaanesh's mechanics, since they're related.
* Since you mentioned chaos corruption, I know that each god has their own form of chaos corruption, but do different gods suffer from another god's corruption? If I play a nurgle/khorne coop campaign with my friend will we be hurting each other or will it just be considered ""chaos corruption"" since we're allied? Also how do chaos warriors/beastmen chaos corruption play with the others? Same with daemons of chaos. Basically a list of which ones play well together, which ones conflict, etc. and does being allied with someone change if it affects them negatively.
* Not sure if you guys will get to show this before launch, but if you do I'm incredibly looking forward to see the other campaigns ""Something Rotten in Kislev"" and ""Darkness and Disharmony"". Also showing off how the simultaneous turn times work in a coop campaign and what limitations that has are of particular interest to my friend group.
* Skaven at the start of game 2 were a far cry from what they became once they received their DLC, and needed it more than any of faction. Which game 3 factions do you think would benefit the most from a DLC? Are there any others that you think particularly need it or do all of their base rosters stand up pretty well?

Schools are on the defensive about their pandemic decision-making, their curriculums, their policies regarding race and racial equity and even the contents of their libraries. Republicans — who see education as a winning political issue — are pressing their case for more “parental control,” or the right to second-guess educators’ choices. Meanwhile, an energized school choice movement has capitalized on the pandemic to promote alternatives to traditional public schools.

huxhqlz,RogerBernards,2022-01-30 16:53:29,"The A Trial of Blood and Steel series by Joel Shepherd has a fair bit of characters discussing philosophy and sociology. It's a 4 book military fantasy about a crusade-like war. It has a female MC, who is a warrior and has divided loyalties with friends and family divided across the various sides in the war. 

It's not super dark compared to some modern stuff (no grimdark stuff just for the sake of grimdarkness). The MC is definitely a good person trying to do what she thinks is the right thing, but it is a book about the atrocities of war and when it is and isn't worth it to fight so it isn't exactly sunshine either. 

There's no discussion about LGBTQ issues. There is discussion of ""race"", you could say, in the sense of what makes the identity of a people and a lot of the motivation of the MC is about preventing genocide, but there are zero direct connections drawn to actual real world issues or examples. Gender is a minor topic in the sense that the MC is a woman and a warrior coming from a culture where women traditionally aren't warriors.",/r/Fantasy/comments/sg8org/rfantasy_daily_recommendation_requests_and_simple/huxhqlz/

2. Dynasty Warriors 8 XL Complete: I was a huge fan of the Dynasty Warriors series back when it was on the PS2. When the series moved to the newer systems, I never really got back to them until I played Samurai Warriors 4-2 some time back so this is a game series I want to play again. 

3. Mount &amp; Blade 2 - Bannerlord: Mount &amp; Blade is just one of those games where you can spend hours just going around the land doing random things.

huxjc6w,AlexTheGreat1997,2022-01-30 17:03:58,"I would assume that the teams that  auto-qualify are the Leviathans, Titans, Kings, and Scarabs. Levis are are the current champions, Titans are the current runner-ups. Even with SOT and ScaryD on their new teams, those two rosters should be locked and loaded. SOT was a dominant force against the Dragons and a big reason the Scarabs reached semis, and ScaryD is a two-time world champ; they need not be defended. Kings were just a really good team for basically the whole year and haven't made any changes; no problem letting them in.

The Dragons, Bolts, Warriors, and Hurri's team are a bit up in the air.

The Dragons at least, unlike the Bolts, managed to actually win a game against their quarters opponent. They also have the advantage of just having a historically-dominant roster; as Rival and Ghost, they basically made the League their bitch all the way up to Worlds, and even started off S8 with the same iron grip we had expected them to have. Even their biggest flaw, a new player, has never been a serious detriment for them. Look at Arkyll, sam4soccer, even Hurriwind seemed to fit fairly nicely into their teams really early on.

The Bolts, on the other hand, lost to the future world champions, unlike the Dragons, who lost to a team that lost against the future runner-ups. They also haven't made any roster swaps. Might seem like a negative at first, but it could be a positive when you remember that the Bolts were a fairly strong team, all things considered. Phase 1 runner-ups, came very close to breaking NRG's winstreak in Phase 2, and got a bye at Phase 2 playoffs. Sure, they didn't end the year well, but you can't say this team has zero potential. 

Warriors don't have a shot at getting the auto-in, in my opinion. They were the only all-LAN SPL team to not go to Worlds in any capacity. Hell, they were the only all-LAN SPL team to drop a game a game to an SCC team, period. That, in my opinion, is just indefensible. The best argument you can make for the Warriors (and it's still a bad argument) is that they lost to the Scarabs, a team that would go on to make semis and take a game off of the future runner-ups. But, in my opinion, their placement performance against Sleekness alone is enough to disqualify them from a guaranteed spot. 

Hurri's team... yeah, look, I like Hurri, S8 made me a fan, and I've always liked Snoopy, but... yeah. Lukonium is, I believe, an SPL rookie, Moswal hasn't played in two actual, human years, Duck3y has been on the worst team in the League for two straight years now, and Hurri is making a role swap for the first time in his career (if you don't count the brief period he subbed into Solo for COG). Snoopy is the player I have the fewest reservations about, and he played SCC all last year.

How was the government supposed to know that Japan didn’t also have sleeper cells in the country?

That was probably wrong, but my dad told me to do it that way and none of the other dudes said anything (maybe none of them noticed, or a couple of them wished they could notice). I feel like I was nude, though, because that's exactly what I did the first time after I got back from my mission and had to be told the right clothes to wear.

Also, I thought women who were faithful were promised to be a wife of one of the 2000 stripping (autocorrect did that, and I'm not fixing it) warriors or Captain Moroni or like the millionth wife of JS or BY. Disgusting either way, but I wasn't so sure I was promised a faithful young woman if I died single. I needed to ""stop hanging out"" and ""start asking more girls on dates"".

I think it was mostly bishop roulette. I had a few female friends go through in their late 20s, but only if their bishop thought they were ""mature"" enough for it. Load of shit again.

huxp58l,Obversa,2022-01-30 17:43:29,"If it ever comes up, here is what I copy-paste when people ask about *The Last Samurai*. I feel that it might come in handy if your employer asks, especially since I an an equestrian who did quite a bit of research into its Cavalry connections.

Tom Cruise's character was based on Jules Brunet, a French Cavalry officer, and [Frederick Townsend Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Townsend_Ward), an American mercenary who helped [Westernize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westernize) the Chinese army by forming the [Ever Victorious Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Victorious_Army).

Jules Brunet is definitely distinct in that he, like the samurai, was a horse Cavalryman, albeit of the highly-respected French tradition, still continued at the [Saumur Cavalry School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry_School) today. Brunet's father was a military veterinary doctor, meaning he cared for Cavalry horses, and Brunet himself was posted to the prestigious Horse Artillery Regiment of the [Imperial Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Guard_(Napoleon_III)).

Specifically, Brunet dealt with [horse artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_artillery), and was sent to Japan due to his expertise there. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Detaille_-_Artillerie_%C3%A0_cheval_de_la_Garde_Imperiale.jpg) is what Brunet would have looked like, as a member of the French Imperial Guard.

However, the reason why I say Brunet is ""distinct"" - especially since the movie used him as an influence for its American protagonist - is because the French were much more highly-regarded than the Americans at the time the film is set, especially in terms of Cavalry.

In fact, the Union army had previously sent American generals to France - and Europe - specifically to ""copy"" - or steal - French Cavalry tactics, and recruit European Cavalrymen for the Union vs. the better Confederate Cavalry. This greatly aided the Union in the Civil War.

This is also why the movie also heavily ""borrows"" Brunet as an influence for the protagonist, Captain Nathan Algren, who is stated to have served in the [7th Cavalry Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Cavalry_Regiment). This was because, by Japanese standards, an American Cavalryman of the time period would not be nearly as well-trained and highly regarded as a French Cavalryman, especially an Imperial.

This is especially important to the Japanese samurai who were, above all, [also mounted warriors](https://samurai-world.com/kisouma-samurai-horses/).

Other differences between Brunet (Frenchman) and Algren (American):

* In a letter to French Emperor Napoleon III, Brunet said he stayed in Japan for two reasons: one, [""Vive la révolution""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LonKGuS9uuQ). Two, to help further French political influence in Japan. He could have felt a kinship with the samurai, but this is *not* what Brunet told Napoleon III.
* Brunet returned to France after being saved by a French Navy warship, and was now considered a war criminal by the new Japanese Imperial government under Emperor Meiji. The Meiji government demanded France to return Brunet to Japan to stand trial for his crimes, but Brunet's actions in Japan had become so popularized, famous, and legendary in France that the French refused. Brunet became a French national hero.
* After returning to France, now famous, Brunet was suspended for six months, and rejoined the French army (Imperial Guard) in February 1870, with only a slight loss in seniority. During the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War) of 1870–1871 he was taken prisoner at the [Siege of Metz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Metz_(1870)). The bulk of the Imperial Guard was amongst the army led by Marshal Francois Bazaine, and the entire Guard surrendered. The Guard was formally abolished by the new French [Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic), following the fall of the French Empire.
* After the Franco-Prussian War, Brunet played a key role as a member of the Versailles Army in the suppression of the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune) in 1871. He was made an officer of the [Légion d'honneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour) in September 1871, and posted as [aide de camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide_de_camp) to the Minister of War. Meanwhile, Brunet's former ally, Admiral Enomoto, had become a high-ranking figure in Meiji Japan, and helped clear Brunet of all Japanese war crimes from 1881-1885.
* Brunet never returned to Japan. Instead, he led a brilliant career in the French Army. He retired in 1899 as a a Divisional General and Chief of Staff for the French Minister of War, and died 12 August 1911, aged 73, in [Fontenay-sous-Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontenay-sous-Bois), Paris, France.",/r/IAmA/comments/sfzohe/iama_white_englishman_in_his_40s_who_works_for_an/huxp58l/

Then, they check to see if there's anyone next to their settlement, and if there is, they'll always build a unit in that settlement... if they can.

With Xin-xi, they already have two units out by turn 3, and can't create a third unit because their cap is only pop 2, so they leave their capital completely open on turn 3. Then you can swoop in and take it, and only one of their warriors is in range to hit the guy that's in their capital.

I get all your points and the logic behind but i don't think there's as much value in bringing anyone in at this point that is new to the organization. Also GSWs system is not one you can bring a big in and just tell them... ""Go get em"" there are two motion offenses in the league.  Thats the reason they rarely make moves and often bring guys back into orbit (ie Jordan Bell).  The system takes time to learn and i assure you that is a greater reason for the struggles of the 2020-21 Warriors than we lend it conversation.  No preseason... COVID practice restrictions... unique system.  Bell's actually the player they'll bring in if they decide they need an extra 5-man.  He knows the system and could hit the ground running.

Note i actually mentioned big men available... and future suggestions. You explained well why you're frustrated but leave me thinking you want ""something anything"" but moves are just as likely to go the Anderson Varejo end state as they are the Andrew Bogut end state (which was NOT an instant hit to be fair).   Most suggestions seem to center around Turner.  Reality is any move made if a move via trade were made would probably net a player more like Mike Muscala Khem Birch ect not Holmes or Turner (who os injured too btw and frankly is the Kelly Oubre of big men he is a functional misfit with a motion offense; few veteran ballers make worse decisions moving the ball a to b to c than Myles).

The previous seasons (which the Sixers also did not win a title) and the experience he got from them are the only reason he has become this good. 

If we go to the playoffs and ultimately don't win a title but get experience and knowledge, and not just Embiid but guys like Maxey and Thybulle, then it's not a waste. It's what is needed to get better and hopefully be an even better team next season. 

Giannis didn't just walk on to the court last year and win a title. He and his team used the previous seasons of failures and disappointments to get better and acquire knowledge and ultimately win a title last year. Same with the Warriors, same with most teams throughout history. Very rarely do you win without struggle and failure first. Even MJ had to go through the Bad Boy Pistons.

It is hugely advantageous in combat. It provides intelligent players a means of trivializing a number of enemies.

Especially with how 5e monsters are designed (many are much weaker at ranged combat than melee combat).

A player that can basically choose to ignore melee enemies when they desire is incredibly powerful in combat. Especially on a reach wielding melee warrior.

Not only is being able to ignore hindering and blocking terrain far more important than you are giving credit to, but also being able to bypass enemy formations to attack vulnerable targets in the rear is something most melee warriors are completely incapable of doing. And since most creatures only means of locking foes down is engaging in melee combat with the threat of opportunity attacks, flying creatures can choose to basically bypass that entire aspect of combat when they want to.

Sure, some enemies might have reach weapons. And a few even have ranged attacks that are as good as their melee attacks.

But when you have melee combatants who can choose to become immune melee attack and opportunity attacks from a large portion of every single monster manual, then flight is providing a huge advantage.

If you’re a girl and you feel more comfortable writing something romantic in the pov of a girl it’ll come out better and more realistic than the other way. 

Most of the time I write romance in the pov of the man because for me it comes out better this way. That or I just focus on what’s going on plot wise and when romance comes about I just say “she realized that she loved so and so had loved him for years” and kinda move on unless it’s “then they kiss/embrace etc…”

huxwgj7,_SpearoftheChurch_,2022-01-30 18:32:18,"I mean, if we are discounting the Thu'um and I assume Sword Singing, etc. then probably not.

 The strongest mages can make whole islands dissapear and reappear wherever they want. (Psijic monks) They can fly, shoot magic, manipulate the mind, and even protect themselves from physical damage. They can manipulate the fabric of reality itself with tonal magic. I can't imagine even the strongest warriors could handle all of that combined.

Lets name some powerful warriors. Ysmir Wilfharth, Pelinal Whitestrake, Red Eagle, Ysgramor, Gaiden Shinji, Morihaus, and maybe Tiber Septim. Take away any special magical abilities like the Thu'um, enchanted gear, Sword-Singing, Pelinal's Mega-Man arm light cannon, etc. and you are left with formidible warriors, but nothing that can beat a master mage. 

Shalidor, Mannimarco, Jagar Tharn, Potema, Zurin Arctus, Ahzidal, Miraak, just to name a few powerful mages. Jagar Tharn was a true master of Illusion and ruled the Empire for a decade. Mannimarco had the entire Mage's Guild shaking in their boots at the mere rumor of his return. Miraak effectively conquered the island of Solthsteim. You expect some stronk boi with an axe to kill one of these without SOME help?

I doubt even the strongest man with a sword could beat any one of these mages, but that is without any special warrior powers. The thing is, taking away those special gifts is entirely unfair to the arguement.

No, Frost is the benelovent emperor of Universe 6.  He fights on team Universe 6 to gain Champa's support to help Universe 6.

He still uses poison,  but it's because he does not want to harm him oppoents.   The poison is meant to stun his oppoents.   

He fights Piccolo first, and wins in a close fight with the use of his poison.   He then fights Goku, and realizing Goku's power, he agrees to fight him with out the poison needles.

Goku goes Super Saiyan God while Frost assumes his final form.  Frost overpowers Goku who reveals Super Saiyan Blue.   Unable to match Goku, Frost loses the fight.

Frost is disheartened by his loss, but Goku tells him that like his counterpart in Universe 7(Frieza)  could go even further and mentions Golden Frieza.   Goku tells him not to give up.

After that tournament, Frost resumes his post as Universe 6's emperor.

He learns of the Tournament of Power and dispatches his men to get help from the Namekians.  He then rehires Hit and reforms Team Universe 6.   He sends Cabba to recruit more Saiyans.

Frost then goes to recruit one last fighter, who is his father and the former Emperor of Universe 6.

His father is King Cold's Universe 6 counterpart and he joins the team(replacing Dr. Rota)

At the Tournament of Power, Frost and his father fight numerous warriors.   Frost's father is soon targeted by Frieza who overwhelms him.

Frost steps in to protect his father, and fights Frieza.  The two are evenly matched before they transform into their Golden Forms.

Frost's father joins his son, and the Emperors of Universe 6 fight Golden Frieza.   The two begin to overwhelm Frieza forcing Gohan to step in.

Gohan and Frieza fight Frost and his father, and after a long fight, both are finally eliminated.

huxxa1z,VeryBoredSidhe,2022-01-30 18:37:35,"Helps if people stop viewing Religion, Politics, Philosophy, Culture, Cults, Economics, Race(if you factor in Epigenetics), etc. As separate things and instead see them for what they are...groups of people with an opinion on reality and how things work and so each has ways they feel are best.

For example a Culture of warriors may worship(Religion) the warrior God(value the warrior archetype and warrior skills) to the exclusion of other archetypes. They will naturally have preferences and habits that aid with being a warrior when these become the norm they also become Morals(what makes me a better warrior is good what makes me a bad warrior is evil) and Laws(collective likes and dislikes)....their Economics may be based upon war, hunting, mercenary work or raiding since they only have skill at war they can only get resources by using those skills...their Philosophy may subconsciously hold ""might makes right"" and their politics may take the form of a stratocracy or something.

The human need to chop everything up into separate pieces has left them blind in ways and lead to them overcomplicating certain things especially in the social sphere...Secularism...it was a mistake of Extreme Reductionistic Materialism which is the new global religion(collective unconscious belief about reality) for most...regardless of conscious beliefs(what they openly identify as)...

Starting a philosophical temple of sorts can be done in a few ways...hold open park events where anyone can come and talk about humanities related topics or you can get together with friends, put money together, buy a large house and turn it into a temple where the religion is about becoming as objective and knowledgeable as possible and studying as many perspectives as possible..maybe",/r/spirituality/comments/sg7yhn/understanding_not_love/huxxa1z/

The monks asked if they should protect those they thought were innocent even if it would require violence. The Buddha said yes. The monks then went directly into the war zone to protect. The Buddha went as well. He created a Buddha field encompassing all beings in the war zone. The peace and compassion he radiated caused warriors on both sides  to stop being violent and leave.

85: 59-win Bucks team, 3rd-most wins in the regular season behind the Showtime Lakers and Bird Celtics

86: 67-win Celtics, considered by many to be one of the top-10 teams of all time. Jordan also dropped 63 on them after missing most of the season due to injury

87: 59-win Celtics, eventual East Champ

88: 54-win Pistons, eventual East Champ, lost the Finals in 7 games to the Lakers despite outscoring them in the series

89: 63-win Pistons, swept the Finals against the Lakers while losing 2 games to the Bulls

90: 59-win Pistons, B2B champions, Bulls took them to 7 games while the Pistons won the Finals in 5 games

LeBron’s 07 run:

Wizards: 41-41, pretty mediocre team, first round sweep

Nets: 41-41, another mediocre team, Cavs win in 6

Pistons: 53-win team, in the 5th year of a 6-year streak where they made the ECF. Definitely a very strong win by LeBron.

Spurs: 58-win team with three future HOFers and depth out the wazoo. The Cavs were better than people retroactively give them credit for (especially on defense) but were very clearly outmatched here.

Link's reasoning is more ambiguous if you're strictly looking at official lore. Officially, each Link is the ""spirit of the hero"" which means Link could hypothetically reincarnate from any species/gender since the spirit doesn't get passed by bloodlines like Zelda and [there's nothing in the lore that specifically says the hero must be male](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAthleteLoophole) that I'm aware of. You could reach and say that Link hasn't always been a male at least, given that in Hyrule Warriors we have Linkle as a playable character but that's not a canon character.

The way that I would explain the reasoning for Link always being human it is that Hylia chose humans as ""her people"" when she chose to raise Skyloft from Hyrule and only brought humans to Skyloft. The cycle of reincarnation only happens within the human species because those were the goddess's ""chosen race"".",/r/botw/comments/sgokup/link_and_zelda_confusing_reincarnation/huxzzhw/

But I do think they were an excellent launch-pad for continuing those ideas, and making expansion storylines feel more *personally* relevant.

Like, as a Warrior, how cool might it have been for Odyn to say ""Listen, I can't divulge all of my connections to the Shadowlands, but word has reached my ears that Helya has made her way there. I would send you to follow her, and further hone your skills with some of the greatest warriors of eternity"". It would give you some context for just ""showing up"".

And I'd hardly keep the Halls stagnant. Hunters and Rogues both got the short end of the stick, so perhaps Rogues would get a revamped Ravenholdt Manor (maybe even just moving the ""sewer"" assets to underneath the manor). Maybe Hunters would discover a new, unclaimed island with sort of a ""Savannah"" aesthetic, in which each race erects its own interpretation of ""Hunter's lodge"", creating a small village?

huy0mdt,Werevulvi,2022-01-30 18:59:41,"I don't have the same dysphoria pattern as you (mine is reverse, as is much more common) but like I can relate to feeling lopsided, feeling weird about dating gay men, and having wondered if it all makes me nonbinary. 

First things first: men can have gynecomastia and I've seen many pre-op trans men who pass just fine as male despite no top surgery. They just looked like men with tits, tbh. And I mean they were not small. Bigger than B-cup, probably smaller than E-cup, as it's hard to guess exact size. Flat chest is only really relevant to passing pre-t. After T has had its effect, tits or not don't matter as much to passing, for most guys. 

Also, I arguably definitely see far more cis men with tits (yes including severe gynecomastia) than I see cis men with vaginas. Aside from the one off detransitioned man, and intersex man, vaginas on men just kinda doesn't happen. Yet, transmeds in general are quicker to go sus on you than they are to go sus on me. Riddle me that. Perhaps projection? I dunno.

But then can you be a trans man without top dysphoria? I can't answer that. I am not the arbiter of trans identities. But I see it kinda like this, alright: If you see yourself as a man, wish you were male, feel good about passing as male, etc, that is probably better to go by than what exact body parts you are or are not dysphoric about, imo. I feel like generally, nonbinary want/need to be ambiguous, not necessarily part by part, but as a whole, while trans men instead want/need to be male, again not necessarily part by part, but as a whole. So if your ""goal as a whole"" is male, then I'd say you're a trans man, and if it's instead ambiguity, then I'd say you're nonbinary. So then discussions around ""can men have vaginas?"" and ""can men have breasts?"" etc, just feel kinda redundant to me. 

I sometimes ask myself ""what if cis men...?"" kinda questions to help guide me. Like in my case I have asked myself ""what if a cis man got vaginoplasty and didn't hate it, but had no wish to present or be female in any other way, would he not be a man then?"" And my instinctive answer was that... no, of course, he'd be a man with a vagina then! You can ask yourself the same question about a hypothetical cis man with gynecomastia and not fuzzed about it. Also when thinking of cis men like that, best is to try not to assume how they would or would not feel about their own bodies. Any way of feeling is possible.

I've figured I'm just a (trans) man who kinda likes having a vagina, and like that's not a big deal. People raging at (sorry I dunno how to censor on mobile) ""cuntboys"" online is just so extra. Like dude, I'm just here trying to make the most of my shit life, for god's sake lemme enjoy some PIV with my T! Who is it hurting? Trans men with bottom dysphoria who don't wanna be associated with me? Great, they can just not associate themselves with me then! No skin off my back. 

But like yeah, dating is hard. I still stick to dating bi men, I guess. If they ever have problems with facing biphobia from the cis men and women they date, they'd be fully accepted by me. Bisexuals get too much hate. Trans people also get too much hate. So that's some solidarity right there. And if they then fully accept my trans body as it is, then that's great. And that would be a great relationship. 

I'm asking myself: do I really need gay cis men's approval? I don't think so. If bi men can give me everything I need in a partner, and I can give something unique that perhaps at least they can love, even if I struggle with it, with feeling inadequate... then that's a good thing. I'm not really losing out on not being wanted by gay men. But yeah, it is still kinda painful, like a loss, because it reminds me I'll never be ""male enough"" for them, and that makes me feel like I'm not even male enough to be a man at all then. If I am judged so harshly by men who only love other men. 

But thing is gay men are the harshest judges of an ftm's passability. THE harshest judges! Because they are male they know a lot about being men, and because they're only into men, they scrutinize other men harder than any other sexuality-gender combination. So then I remind myself that I'm setting myself up to a too high standard. That I shouldn't have to cut myself down to please other people, when I'm fine with myself as I am. Then maybe I should just... forget about gay men, seriously. If kissing their feet is only ever gotta lead to me getting my teeth kicked in, then maybe it's better to walk away from them instead. Because that's not a great way to live.

Like I get that you're not at a ""fine with myself as I am"" point since you haven't yet reached your transition goal, but like... that could be you in the future, right? 

And like yeah, I am a lil truscum shit too, so obviously I draw the limit somewhere, in what kinda people I think could be considered men and not men. I mean, I wouldn't think someone who doesn't wish they were male in a general sense is a man. But like not having dysphoria about just one off trait ain't such a big deal in whole big picture of things. It only becomes a red flag to me really, when maleness in general is simply not the goal. And like I can relate to you, because even though my type of lopsidedness is much more common than yours, we both essentially just have like ""one off trait"" that makes people question our transness, right? So to me it feels like a similar (non-)issue. Yet it's one that I also struggle with, really a lot, so I don't mean to downplay it.

But I'm also very aware of that people in general put a lot more weight on top dysphoria than bottom dysphoria for ftm, and the reverse for mtf. I guess that comes from that people *usually* get more uncomfortable about what (both figuratively and literally in this case) sticks out. But that doesn't mean that it has to be that way. Dysphoria isn't always logical. Generally it is, yes, but not when it comes down to details. Like for example me being dysphoric about having a long neck is not logical, but that doesn't change how I feel. 

And like if that's you, but keyboard warriors keep pestering you about your dysphoria or lack there of, maybe taking a break from the internet could be a wise idea. Like when I see enough hate towards trans men who like their vaginas, that's when I know I've had enough internet for that day, and I need to try to log off and practice some irl self care.",/r/truscum/comments/sghfiu/lopsided_dysphoria/huy0mdt/

Dark Souls 2 is okay. It's good, not great. It's the worst one yeah, but being the worst one in an excellent series doesn't change the fact that you're still very good.

There have always been way too many covenants. There should be like... Four. One low level PvP (Forest Hunter) one low level PvE (Way of White) one high level PvP (Chaos Servant or Way of the Dragon) and one high level PvE (Warriors of Sunlight.)

Dark Souls doesn't need an easy mode because it already has one. You can kindle bonfires for more Estus, you can upgrade your armour and weapons, you can invest into miracles for extra healing and some late game ranged attacks, the game gives you countless ways to modulate your difficulty so that the PvE experience suits you. Dark Souls doesn't need a hard mode because Soul Level 1 runs exist. What Dark Souls *does* need is better tutorialisation to tell you that this method of difficulty selection exists.

The Nameless King is named Sen, notice the snake men from Sen's Fortress are also at Archdragon Peak.

The flow of time is NOT convoluted. If it were convoluted there wouldn't be a chronology to NPC interactions. You could rescue dusk before she was kidnapped by Manus. You could fight the Laurentius hollow in blight town then go back up to firelink and have him upgrade your flame some. It would be better to say the flow of time is stagnant in Lordran. Because a bunch of heroes can have the same adventure at the same time.

(Real controversy here) not counting twink builds stomping on low level players, the PvP experience is perfectly balanced, you're just bad. Quit getting mad.

I really like batching weird tribes with more common ones but there doesn't seem to be a great thematic link between samurai (a class of soldiers who held a high social standing and had a rigid code of conduct in Japanese society).

But this is par the course for wizards, who can't seem to decide what whites 'little tribe' is (or purposely prints many different but functionally similar tribes to keep them from getting too powerful).",/r/magicTCG/comments/sgoyww/neo_raiyuu_storms_edge/huy3dwn/

I don't think you're actually reading what I'm writing. I'm trying to explain to you that every Wu Lin, save for Zhanhu, **currently has no allegiance to the Empire, just like Pirate**. 


They may have *formerly* had allegiance to the Empire (Tiandi, Jiang Jun, Nuxia) or simply lived in China without serving the Empire at all (Shaolin), but they no longer do, and are here **escaping the Empire, fighting for their own individual reasons, just like Pirate.**

huy4g8o,11BApathetic,2022-01-30 19:27:35,"The best thing I saw, and I used the same comment talking to a friend of mine about a similar thing, it's like a Gladiator vs a Roman Legionary. Mandalorians in general are pretty great individual and clan based warriors. They excel in swift strikes with small unit tactics. Overpowering weaker enemies who can't concentrate force against them by using their speed/armor/skill to achieve their goals. What they aren't is an army. 

Even an army won't typically deploy their special forces into the center of a conventional battle, they are built for an entirely different type of warfare. While the special forces would still be able to hold their own because they are skilled and have experience, battles are colossal and titanic things. It takes one artillery shell to annihilate an extremely valuable team that would be better served elsewhere putting their leveraging their strengths against the enemies weaker backlines. 

Now you have the Mandalorians, who have no armor, no air support, no naval support, limited numbers, and fighting in a siege situation against armor, air support, and naval support. No matter how good you are,  the odds are very against you at that point. Not to mention these Mandalorians are depleted. They are extremists that took power over a pacifist government with a largely pacifist population. They are now pitted against a veteran and organized military. It doesn't matter that in a straight fight 1 Mandalorian might take out 5 clones, because behind those 5 clones are a bunch of other clones, heavy weapons, and support aircraft ready to come in and blast that Mandalorian to bits. They would have been entirely better off letting Mandalore be captured and waging a long guerilla campaign, but that wasn't the goal, so while it would be better for them it wasn't an explored strategy. 

Armies are entirely different beasts, and you can be the most skilled combatant in the world and still end up on a battlefield killed by a stray bullet from a conscript or an artillery shell. This is entirely why the Rebellion/New Republic hardly engages the Empire in open drag out fights until post Endor. They just can't. The weight of a war machine coming down on you in a conventional battle where you have nowhere near the resources is an extremely monumental task that many cannot overcome. This is what we see in the recent BOBF episode and TCW Siege of Mandalore. The Mandalorians are extremely skilled, but those are fights they will lose. One of the best canon examples I love for Mandalorians in a larger conflict is in Rebels where during the Battle of Atollon. They fly in behind the Imperial battle line and disable an Interdictor with a swift and precise strike. Never openly engaging in a conventional fight.",/r/MawInstallation/comments/sgdfa3/mandalorians_vs_clones_combat_and_skills/huy4g8o/

huy5172,Gr8zomb13,2022-01-30 19:31:58,"Playing:  

I have about 7000pts Death Guard. My DG is about 50% old dudes which I never (ever) use, and have been contemplating selling about 100 of these “old breed” off in groups of 5-10, and reinvesting in a couple things I haven’t got yet from the new range. 

I also have about 7000pts of Necrons. Got back into the hobby w/ Indomitus and bought two Necron halves. I was lucky enough to pickup an ebay lot w/warriors with an old monolith for $70, and along with 20 immortals have a huge base for an army. I still need to get a second DDA/GA, two more heavy destroyers, the void dragon, and lychguard to build the force. I’d also like to pick up some acanthrites and those tomb caterpillars, mostly because they’re cool looking. 

Lastly, I have a small Chaos Knights list. I have a tyrant, defiler (w/all options magnetized), and four wardogs. I started this most recently because I bought some ebay rescue wardogs off ebay for about $30/pair. I am a super casual player, so I just thought these doobers could carry a mark of nurgle and attach to my army. Wrongo. So I bought the rest over xmas break. Still might pick up the new Chaos Knight model when it pops this year and I will definitely be popping for a pair of moiraxes down the line. One thing that does disappoint is that the Chaos knights aren’t daemon engines. So I thought it might be cool to augment a smaller knights force w/ a lord of skulls or a kytan ravager or greater brass scorpion. 

Future plans?  

I always wanted a Tau force.  Might get around to it in a year or two, but honestly it’s 50/50 whether I’ll go that route. 

I also might need to consider a straight-leg CSM list, but w/ a daemonkin lean to it. I already have a few venom crawlers, an LOP, obliterators, greater possessed, and possessed to start the force, but would really love some forgefiends, a helldrake, another LOP, a lord discordant, and a few more CSM squads to flesh it out. 

Lastly, and this is the real wish list, is to make a 3d Space Hulk board. I’ve seen some others do it, but not with see-through deck plating, leds, fog, and “spooky ship” sounds.",/r/Warhammer40k/comments/sgp7mp/what_faction_do_you_playare_going_to_play_want_to/huy5172/

Axes are great for reaching over and ripping shields down (using a double handed axe come over the top of your shield wall place the bottom ""spike"" of the axe edge behind the rim of opposing shield and rip it towards you creating a gap).

huy741o,mr_backster,2022-01-30 19:47:57,"A 16-year-old boy in China stole 280,000 yuan (about 1.25 million Taiwan dollars) that his parents had worked so hard to keep at home, all of which were used for stored-value online games, and was caught by his parents in an Internet cafe. Angered parents grab the computer screen and smash their son in the head, and the video has recently gone viral on Chinese social media.  
  
According to comprehensive foreign media reports, the 16-year-old boy stole 280,000 yuan in cash from his home, purchased all the game points, stored value in the online game ""Dungeon and Warriors"" (DNF) in the Internet cafe, and instantly became an uncle in the game.  
  
But the parents rushed to the Internet cafe and saw their son was having so much fun. When they got emotional, they first beat the boy with their fists, and then smashed them with the monitor on the table. The entire Internet cafe could hear the boy's wail.  
  
Many Chinese netizens were aware of the incident and shared the same hatred with the parents. They left messages saying, ""This is going to be beaten! Beat to death"", ""Maybe the 280,000 is the savings of most of my life""; but some netizens pointed out that the teenager lied to his parents to ask for it When I went to school, I was caught playing games at an internet cafe. My parents beat people when they were emotional, not stealing money to store value.

huy8drm,SleepDivision,2022-01-30 19:57:54,"Welcome to the first Plus Club of 2022! Hope you're all doing well and are ready to discuss the games offered on PS Plus in January. We played Dirt 5, Deep Rock Galactic and Persona 5 Strikers so let's talk about it.  
  
Firstly I gave Dirt 5 a SOLID B+ for it's self aware arcadey gameplay and emphasis on off road racing. It's a good looking, clean and smooth experience with a great roster of tracks and vehicles. Progression is simple and effective with the races being bracketed and the dual sense functionality is a fun experience. I had a lot of fun returning to Dirt 5 and recommend you try it out if your looking for a fun arcade racer.  
  
I gave a long-time favorite of mine Deep Rock Galactic, a well deserved A+ for it's fantastic co op gameplay, charming design, huge amount of content and procedurally generated replayability. The PS5 port is great, looks great, performs great and though I prefer M+K for this game, the controls work well and the gryo aiming is a fun feature that seems to work best for fine tune mining. The new season is great and adds a ton of new things to unlock and being free is a aweomse plus to it. Overall I had a blast visiting this great game on PS5 and absolutely loved it.   
  
Lastly I gave Persona 5 Strikers a B for it's authentic visuals, style and gameplay mechanics continuing the Persona 5 story in this Dynasty Warriors/Persona hybrid. The world and social features feel the same as the original JRPG but the combat feels like an interesting hybrid of 2 different genres which was a lot of fun to play. My major hurdle with this game is that I have not finished the OG Persona 5 and so I skipped a lot of story to play this for Plus Club. So once I've finished Persona 5 I will be able to return to this and give it a proper try. Overall I'm excited to be able to dive into this game later.  
  
Alright that's it for me but let me know what you thought of the games and how are you feeling about UFC 4, Planet Coaster Console Edition and Tiny Tina's Assault of Dragons Keep? Lemme know!",/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/sgrnlz/every_month_we_play_the_games_offered_on/huy8drm/

Lol. if the warriors didn't have those 3 they would all be on a other team, its actually hilarious someone would say this. 

Niang, Shake, and Korkmaz are all really bad. I would immediately take Nemanja, Kuminga and Otto over them. Iggy is a fine rotation player as well. 

Poole, Draymond, Wiggins, Looney &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Drummond, Maxey, Tobias, Seth curry, and yes Thybulle. 

Also the fact that you put Drummond as a ""former all star"" is ridiculous. He has not been even close to as good as he was back then. And when he was a all-star it was very controversial.

On top of that, the Warriors have a playmaker in Draymond while the Sixers have zero good playmakers as you listed. I think Maxey is their best playmaker and while he is a good ppg scorer he can not facilitate a offense well.

huy9uig,Quaffiget,2022-01-30 20:09:36,"I'd probably judge ""advanced"" by the logistics. The scale-of-production.

The Imperium outnumbers the Tau. So if you gather every Space Marine in the galaxy and compare them to the total Fire Warriors of Battlesuits available to the Tau, the Tau probably don't hold up well.

But if you adjust for the smaller empire that the Tau have, the average Imperial trooper has a lasgun or worse, while a Pulse weapon is just the standard infantry small arm for Fire Warriors. And they actually know how their tech works, it isn't degrading or a lost relic nobody can reproduce.

Custodian gear and Rosarius are so prohibitively expensive, that while ""advanced,"" the Imperium no longer has the institutional knowledge or economy to churn out for mass production.

IIRC Custodian gear is supposed to rival the cost of a planet or something ridiculous like that. But that could just be grimderp.",/r/40kLore/comments/sg8ze3/is_custodian_technology_superior_to_tau_eldar_or/huy9uig/

I love em because they have great OTK-ability and not just because they can get big beefy boys out. On the way to that OTK board you get 1-2 monster bounces, potential for an s/t negate, and potentially another monster pop. And then if for whatever reason you don't get that OTK, you can use those bounces and monster pop for your opponent's turn too.

Additionally, there are a lot of warriors floating around. They were undoubtedly the most used PvE class in Classic and one of the most dominant in both PvE and PvP. Naturally, with all the TBC meta shifts and class changes, many re-rolled, but maintained their warriors as alts. Well, for PvP they're popular, but we're seeing that their PvE potential is also quite a lot better than was initially anticipated.

&gt;In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.
&gt;
&gt;Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father’s failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her father’s former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.
&gt;
&gt;Now, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic—the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, she’ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Church’s halls, the bloody secrets of Mia’s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.
&gt;
&gt;Will she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?

^(By: Elizabeth Moon | 1040 pages | Published: 1992 | Popular Shelves: fantasy, fiction, owned, epic-fantasy, high-fantasy)

&gt;The Deed of Paksenarrion revolves around the life of Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter, known as Paks. It takes place in a fictional medieval world comprised of kingdoms of humans, dwarves, and elves. The story begins by introducing Paks as a headstrong girl of 18, who leaves her home (fleeing a marriage arranged by her father) to join a mercenary company. Through her journeys and hardships she comes to realize that she has been gifted as a paladin. The novel was originally published in three volumes in 1988 and 1989 and as a single trade edition of that name in 1992. The three books included are The Sheepfarmer's Daughter, Divided Allegiance and Oath of Gold.
&gt;
&gt;From publisher Baen: ""Paksenarrion, a simple sheepfarmer's daughter, yearns for a life of adventure and glory, such as was known to heroes in songs and story. At age seventeen she runs away from home to join a mercenary company and begins her epic life . . . Book One: Paks is trained as a mercenary, blooded, and introduced to the life of a soldier . . . and to the followers of Gird, the soldier's god. Book Two: Paks leaves the Duke's company to follow the path of Gird alone—and on her lonely quests encounters the other sentient races of her world. Book Three: Paks the warrior must learn to live with Paks the human. She undertakes a holy quest for a lost elven prince that brings the gods' wrath down on her and tests her very limits.""

&gt;Enter an epic fantasy world that echoes with the thunder of muskets and the clang of steel—but where the real battle is against a subtle and sinister magic....
&gt;
&gt;Captain Marcus d’Ivoire, commander of one of the Vordanai empire’s colonial garrisons, was resigned to serving out his days in a sleepy, remote outpost. But that was before a rebellion upended his life. And once the powder smoke settled, he was left in charge of a demoralized force clinging tenuously to a small fortress at the edge of the desert.
&gt;
&gt;To flee from her past, Winter Ihernglass masqueraded as a man and enlisted as a ranker in the Vordanai Colonials, hoping only to avoid notice. But when chance sees her promoted to command, she must win the hearts of her men and lead them into battle against impossible odds.
&gt;
&gt;The fates of both these soldiers and all the men they lead depend on the newly arrived Colonel Janus bet Vhalnich, who has been sent by the ailing king to restore order. His military genius seems to know no bounds, and under his command, Marcus and Winter can feel the tide turning. But their allegiance will be tested as they begin to suspect that the enigmatic Janus’s ambitions extend beyond the battlefield and into the realm of the supernatural—a realm with the power to ignite a meteoric rise, reshape the known world, and change the lives of everyone in its path.

&gt;Gifted with metahuman powers in a world full of capes and villains, Tori Rivas kept away from the limelight, preferring to work as a thief in the shadows. But when she's captured trying to rob a vault that belongs to a secret guild of villains, she's offered a hard choice: prove she has what it takes to join them or be eliminated. Apprenticed to one of the world's most powerful (and supposedly dead) villains, she is thrust into a strange world where the lines that divide superheroes and criminals are more complex than they seem. The education of a villain is not an easy one, and Tori will have to learn quickly if she wants to survive. On top of the peril she faces from her own teacher, there are also the capes and fellow apprentices to worry about, to say nothing of having to keep up a civilian cover. Most dangerous of all, though, are those who loathe the guild's very existence. Old grudges mean some are willing to go to any length to see the guild turned to ash, along with each one of its members. Even the lowly apprentices.

&gt;A world that exists in the shadows of our own.
&gt;
&gt;A conflict we will never see.
&gt;
&gt;One woman stands between those determined to control history and those who will risk their lives for freedom.
&gt;
&gt;Maya is hiding in plain sight in London. The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins—a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.
&gt;
&gt;Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living “off the Grid”—that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.
&gt;
&gt;Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula—ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms—one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.
&gt;
&gt;Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own. John Twelve Hawks' stunningly suspenseful debut is an international publishing sensation that marks the arrival of a major new talent.

huybz5h,Well-MeaningCisIdiot,2022-01-30 20:27:10,"Yugi/Atem - past at least 5D's, their decks' Spell/Trap support - aside from the broken draw spells - would intermingle immeasurably to accommodate as many concepts as possible. Into Vrains, we'd probably see at least four cards that can each support Kuriboh and Fusion and Magnet Warrior and Buster Blader and DMG specifically - for a start - all in one. That, or pick whatever lore that's new at the time and involves at least five different archetypes in it, and give him a deck based on as many as possible.

Judai - dial him back to DM? Not much changes, tho he'd certainly get to use Pot of Greed, Mirror Force and Solemn Judgment more than just the one time. Afterwards...definitely ditching the Chrysalises finally...I *would* say he'd use the omni-HERO Fusions and the Masked HEROes, except those are already taken up by his manga counterpart...by Vrains, I'm gonna go with Elementsabers. If they're not allowed earlier, I'm not sure; the goal should be to have a full array of Attributes, with an emphasis on LIGHT ascension, somewhere.

Yusei - Yusei's deck's entire thing is using whatever he can scrounge up. Ergo, what's a crappy style of deck from each era that he'd just make work somehow? For right now, off-handedly...DM - Union (not X-to-Z); GX - Gemini; Zexal - not sure (Artifacts?), but if he took the protag slot, his schtick would definitely revolve around using whatever random Numbers aren't a part of another archetype; Arc-V - ...Koa'ki Meiru?; Vrains - I'm guessing...dunno; everything mechanical or draconic is already taken...

Yuma - In 5D's, we'd probably see some Onomat Tuners somewhere, and I'd expect generic Warrior Synchros aplenty, especially if Level 8 (Colossal Fighter, anyone?). In GX...I'm inclined to say Fusions, given his spiritual arc of more literal overlays (coming together), but aside from making up some Onomat Fusions, I just don't know. Maybe some kind of Nomi monsters...? In DM, generic EARTH Warrior/Spellcaster decks, your Marauding Captains, your Frontier Wisemans, the works. Probably some of those same kind of Fusions, too. Arc-V...tellarknights?

Yuya - Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Arkana's style of Dark Magician deck wouldn't right up his alley. Cut the executioner's tools in favor of some showy monsters and more theatrical attire for the DM support, and it might work out fine. 5D's I can't think of a fitting archetype, but you just know he'd be on a bike tricked out for all manner of unique stunts (no, his Riding Duels in Arc-V don't count, as he wasn't born to the world). 

Yusaku - Remove the cyberspace - sorry, ""Cynet"" - motifs, and his deck as is is a conventional mix of Spellcaster/Warrior collaboration with a handful of Beasts and lesser Dragons, ascending into massively powerful Dragons. Every Attribute gets representation. So...hmm. Not knowing the depths of the meta that hasn't gotten anime representation as well as I'd like...DM - full-on Gaia the Fierce Knight (but ascending into something other than Black Luster Soldier, given how close it is to Yugi/Atem); GX - given the various ""Styles"" implied between higher-order Machine archetypes, I'm gonna say Yusaku would represent some kind of integration between them all (i.e. Cyber Dragon, Jinzo, Cyber Ogre); 5D's - Scrap/Iron Chain, especially if we get more Dragons and Warriors, or, to maintain multiple Attributes, Genex (don't scoff, you know HE of all people would still drive them to tier-1, SOMEHOW); Zexal - I wanna say...Geargia; Arc-V - If permitted, Virtual World, esp. if they could get a Fusion.

Yuga - DM: Magical Scientist is the ace, and combos derive from there. GX: Charmers and their familiars, buttressed by Baboons (maybe at a later date, with the broader support). 5D's: Gladiator Beasts, if still allowed. Maybe some Machine archetype, at least on the side, to represent his inventor's spirit, like Scraps, Junk or Karakuri. Zexal: Wind-Up. Arc-V: Noble Knights, plus the Magician Pendulums that stand in for the Dimension Dragons.

&gt;1. It isn't feudalism, dummy, it's property rights.  Feudalism would require fealty to a regional leader.

That's not accurate, but honestly, I don't feel like teaching you what feudalism is.

&gt;2. That's not how all taxes work.  Everyone benefits from police, fire, etc.  Not everyone benefits from universal healthcare, welfare, public schools, etc.

Not everyone benefits from police OR fire departments. People who USE them sure do, but for everyone else theyre a drain. Just like universal healthcare (which isn't an America thing), welfare, and public schools.

&gt;No, not feudalism, because that person in power owns nothing.  

Please, every politician in the modern era owns a LOT. But sure  I'm sure the people in charge won't use their money/power to enrich themselves in a libertarian fantasy land.

&gt;How so? The states can work together if they choose, there's no need for the Federal Government to progress, it's redundant. 

Well let me lay out a scenario. Let's say Russia attacked America, right now. And they had spread enough propaganda to depress any war efforts. Now America doesn't have a standing Army, and instead of trying to just coordinate our normal 6 branches, we need to coordinate 300. And if ANY states opt out that's either a loss of important specialized equipment, OR we're spending 50X on the military budget to have redundancies in the case that some states don't want to participate in the wars.

&gt;No, national guard are only paid when training or working, and they are the most deployed of all the branches.  It makes more sense to have them at the ready as they always are, or do you prefer us being world police?

I would personally prefer to have a normal SMALLER standing military and eliminate the national guards/reserves. Standardized training and requirements, plus it's more mobile to have 1 instead of several.

But my changes to the military would be REALLY extensive. But that's a separate discussion.

And yeah, guard gets deployed the most, and? Also ""always at the ready"" is kinda funny to describe weekend warriors.

&gt;Says who?  The constitution guarantees that right, and people did it before cars.  You're making excuses. And no, that's not how it works due to Federal programs

People BARELY did it before cars and a lot of them DIED. Also poor people generally only did it by gloming onto rich people doing it and offering services. The opportunities to do that don't exist anymore.

And how do you think the federal programs work?

&gt;2. Point to a place on the map where slavery is still legal. 

America. Read the 13th amendment, we never made it illegal.

&gt;It is important for you to use the word ""history."" This means it happened in the past.

K. My point stands.

&gt;If I don't, I need to get some money back for my degrees, but it is unlikely.  I could explain to you how little a player the US was in the global slave trade, but you won't listen.  

Lol our economy was deeply intertwined with slaves. But I'm not sure what your point is. That slavery outside of America was bad? Ok, it was. No one is saying differently.

&gt;I'm not, I'm just not considering it a marginal factor.  Anyone who is falsely accused and exonerated gets to sue the shit out of whoever did it to them.

Provided of course that it's A. Discovered, B. Proven, C. Done before their death.

With a bonus of hoping the system actually let's them go.

&gt;You can give me your party's narrative on how that works, but the reality is that a rich person doesn't use welfare, Medicare. SNAP, etc but are somehow expected to pay more for it? for the things they do use, they don't use them more than someone else. 

The wealthy own businesses those businesses cause drains on society, and those drains are paid for by higher taxes. An individual drives a car, a business drives a fleet of trucks. Those trucks then pollute, and that polkution causes health issues, which then drain medicare.

Business owners pay less than living wages. That means people need to go on snap, welfare, medicaid, etc. It should then go to reason that those same business owners are the ones paying for their failure to compensate their employees correctly.

&gt;&gt;Medicine and energy AREN'T federalized, and the Dems AREN'T trying to make that happen.

&gt;Yes, and yes.  

Glad we agree?

&gt;Well, one is made up...so there's that.

They're both ""made up"" so is capitalism, feudalism, fascism, and communism. They're ALL human constructs. I don't know what your point is other than some sad slippery slope argument.

&gt;Allow me to clarify.  I was under the impression that the GOP was just racist rich people who were trying to seize power.  That was wrong, they genuinely are not racist, most are not rich, and they're too incompetent to seize power totally.

The leaders of the GOP are absolutely rich. The voters, eh. They're ABSOLUTELY just trying to seize power to further their fortunes. And considering the odds they're against, they're doing pretty good at seizing power. Tons of incompetent people though, gotta agree on that. Though it applies to most politicians.

&gt;Nope, that's being indifferent to criminals having to fill their time with labor.  You commit a crime, you don't have rights until you've repaid your debt to society.

That's advocating for slavery. You're just rewording the definition of slavery. You're LITERALLY advocating for the removal of human rights and the addition of slavery.

&gt;&gt;Lol doubtful that you can my dude.

&gt;But Aileana only looks the part of an aristocratic young lady. she's leading a double life: She has a rare ability to sense the sìthíchean—the faery race obsessed with slaughtering humans—and, with the aid of a mysterious mentor, has spent the year since her mother died learning how to kill them.
&gt;
&gt;She's a murderer.
&gt;Now Aileana is dedicated to slaying the fae before they take innocent lives. With her knack for inventing ingenious tools and weapons—from flying machines to detonators to lightning pistols—ruthless Aileana has one goal: Destroy the faery who destroyed her mother.
&gt;
&gt;She's a Falconer.
&gt;The last in a line of female warriors born with a gift for hunting and killing the fae, Aileana is the sole hope of preventing a powerful faery population from massacring all of humanity. Suddenly, her quest is a lot more complicated. She still longs to avenge her mother's murder—but she'll have to save the world first.
&gt;

&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?
&gt;
&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old.

If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.
&gt;
&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?

&gt;The C’tan, as far as our legends attest, were essential components of creation – hungry, evil to mortal eyes, but part of it. They require no belief to live, in the same way the suns they devoured require no observer to be. Nor do the great four gods of Chaos, who have become so all-powerful they are in essence self-sustaining, though the faith of their followers makes them stronger. **Nor does the Great Devourer, the mind of the tyranids, a being that is generated by the unthinking actions of its physical component parts, and that is perhaps greater than all the rest. Is that a god? Some of our philosophers argue so. Others vehemently disagree.** But for other gods, lesser gods, faith is vital. Without faith, they collapse into formlessness, becoming non-sentient vortices of emotion. Unstable, they die.

Here's lore and link to my Archduke. :)

Tel’ithin, the Soul Tree, Archduke of the Iron Winter Wargrove.  
One of the few spirits to survive the destruction of the World-That-Was, saved by the might and grace of the Everqueen. The first of his grove whose soulpod was touched by the fingers of the Everwinter, and so gained its icy chill. Now awoken, he leads his Wargrove forward as unceasingly as the roaring blizzard that froze his heart.  
In his moments of lucidity, some say you can see again the grandeur of Athel Loren of old. For in these rare times he remembers once more the glittering wonder of the Waterfall Palace and the warmth of the sun beneath the Oak of Ages. But these moments are fleeting; and when they pass, he hears more clearly the thunder of the Horn of Kurnous in the Last Battle at the End of Days; and through him into his warriors the Wrath of Durthu the Forest Father is renewed.  
The twisted followers of Chaos have learned fear for the deep places of the wood, for beneath the tangled boughs lies only an icy, strangling doom.

huyhegf,Sivartius,2022-01-30 21:15:10,"What They Are Known For: Well there are a lot of exceptional things about them, but the things that get talked about the most are: Their new marines spend their first decade (until their first progenoids grow in and are immediately harvested,) on defensive/garrison/admin duty. So their scouts are very different. They also make heavy use of beasts to aid them, with each marine having one to six they can send out (Pokemon). And they have families. I've heard a lot of debate about whether Space Marines are sterile but these definitely are not. And one of the duties of a Space Marine is to father future Space Marines. It also helps keep them in touch with mortal humanity.  
  
Homeworlds: Jumper united a whole area of space before being reunited with Big E, so the recruiting pool is rather diverse. They're somewhat close to the core, so a lot of them are heavy grav mining worlds, and many of the remainder have rather weird effects that some suspect may be Chaos touched. His lands include a few Squat clans, so the gear is first rate, even if none of them can become Astartes.  
  
Fleet: Jumper's fleet is massive, and since he went to most of the other 40k jumps first, he has several Glorianas and a mobile megastation/fortress, but for the ones specific to this jump he's got a Phalanx-style megafortress that was previously an Atlantean city-ship, and a Star Trek Mirror Universe Dreadnought, and a DSII, as well as a Gloriana that was previously a Star Trek Gravestone and an Eclipse SSD, along with a vast array of different ships. Many of whom were import merged with larger ships from previous jumps like ISDs, Venators, an Inexpugnable etc all from Star Wars, and various huge ships from Star Trek Online.  
  
Standard Equipment For Basic Marine: Standard marines have modified Corvus power armor,   
  
Special Standard Equipment: Combination upgraded Phaser Rifles and Schlock Mercenary Plasma Guns, and Lightsabers, along with a varying number of Pokemon, and personal force fields. Also, personal, vehicle, and starship cloaking devices, are all used. A lot of the gear is enchanted using D&amp;D 3.5 or Pathfinder rules. I don't know if you'd consider it ""equipment"", but the gene seed has been tweaked so that the Progenoids regrow, though it takes a bit longer each time. The thing that almost got them purged was developing a secret ritual that allows a male child conceived by a space marine during/shortly after the ritual to grow progenoids and naturally become a space marine.  
  
Legion Name: The Adamant Dragons  
  
Friendly Legions: Salamanders because they share a respect for human life and good craftsmanship, Raven Guard because of their respect for intelligence, and unconventional tactics, Space Wolves because they know how to have fun and don't see themselves quite as set apart as some others, Ultramarines because Guilliman's a good guy and they're always considering the Industrial/Logistical/Civ elements, and Thousand Sons for their curiosity and love of knowledge.  
  
Rival Legions: Iron Warriors and Iron Hands are both jerks. Fulgrim is a creep. Jumper kind of abducted the Night Haunter as a young Primarch, and he's turned out somewhat less messed up, but he's kind of on a narrow edge and is prone to fall either into dangerous absolutist judgements or brooding. Jumper prevented Angron from getting the Butcher's Nails, and bailed out his rebellion a couple of times, eventually kind of doing a lot of the practical non-in your face skull bashing parts of conquering his planet for him, but finds him somewhat unpleasant. Angron is still a pretty blunt instrument, and the only people he really seems to care about is his legion and Jumper, since Jumper saved them. He's not glassing planets, but he doesn't accept negotiated surrenders, and never offers surrender of any type. If someone wants to surrender they have to offer their complete unconditional surrender and he doesn't take into account collateral damage. Also, he gets people killed in direct frontal assaults.",/r/JumpChain/comments/sgma5c/jumpers_whats_your_space_marine_legion_like/huyhegf/

Yes, there are chinese pirates, pirate queen like everyone was posting, but medieval chinese warriors and chinese sailing pirates aren't necessarily on the same playing board. I don't think the Zhanhu or Emperor would 'stoop low enough' (in their eyes I guess) to willingly accept the Pirates into their ranks, and even then, the Pirate lore is specifically her not wanting to join any of the major factions at all. Her 'faction' is the sea. Just because she's Chinese and has Chinese armor doesn't necessarily mean she's part of the Wu Lin. Gryphon has Viking and Chinese armor sets, but he's a Knight. So on and so forth.

I think it's a good pick. Here's hoping it only gets more detached from our current ideas.

huyirgq,BuddhaTheGreat,2022-01-30 21:27:52,"**Name:** Alexander Darkstone

**Current Age:** 160

**Gender:** Born and normalizes to male, can shapeshift

**Mastery:** Command, CQC, Swordplay, Military Weaponry, Magic, Superpowers

**Backstory:** Son of acclaimed Imperial hero turned assumed deserter James Darkstone. Orphaned at a young age in a riot by hyper-loyalists to avenge the treachery of his father. Grew up in a Purist clade and joined the Imperial Armed Forces at 16 years of age. Mentored by the celebrated officer and heir-apparent to the Imperial throne, Obadiah Khan, under whom he served during the Matriarch Campaigns. Subsequently, he fought and defeated Khan when his secret treacheries were discovered in the closing days of the war. He went on to found the Imperial Black Sun special forces and eventually assumed command of War Fleet August Retribution as its High Admiral. Currently, he shares those duties with his post as Lord Regent of the Empire.

**Feats:**

\-Holds undefeated scores in all military basic aptitude tests to date.

\-Fought and killed Grand Admiral Obadiah Khan, one of the most celebrated warriors in Imperial history.

\-Created a Perfect Sacred Domain that covered an entire star system; it is theorized that this is nowhere near his maximum limit.

\-One of the relatively few people in the Empire having the multi-disciplinary capacity (standard combat paradigms, command aptitude, Void-Arithmetic, Ontotechnology, Chronowarfare, Nooplanar combat) necessary to even qualify for Red Sun status. Subsequently passed the trials and remained a member of the Red Suns until he was ordered to purge them on grounds of an impending rebellion. He is still venerated as the Cleanser by modern Red Suns.

\-Single-handedly killed 10,000 Red Suns, Imperial special forces composed of the best soldiers in the entire universe, before the founding of the Black Suns.

\-Founded the Black Suns, the highest tier of elite soldiers in the Empire, and acts as the order's permanent Grandmaster.

\-Destroyed a flotilla of hostile forces with only his sword while asleep.

\-Can channel enough magical force that reality begins to passively decompose around him.

\-Highest causality-breach aptitude in the Empire; can trigger fast enough to defeat instant teleporters.

\-Shrugged off full-power attacks from Undone Paragons of Dralikaar.

\-Successfully retained his consciousness while undergoing the Revenant process, becoming the first Awakened Revenant in history.

\-Only being in history to successfully kill a Transcendent, albeit while empowered by a Dogma Arcanum. The Transcendents have mutually decided to stop interfering in Imperial spheres of interest while he remains alive.

\-Managed to get a uniform exemption from the Imperial Armed Forces, arguably the hardest thing on this list.",/r/goodworldbuilding/comments/sgjcin/what_are_some_of_your_worlds_best_fighters/huyirgq/

So I had certain expectations for it that it could never live up to, with the movie bias, and having read dozens of other much more interesting baseball books. That being said, I think it was compelling enough that it warranted a film, and the film was massively popular. I think it helped get people to care about baseball again this last decade. To me, it didn’t seem like overt bragging, more of saying ‘this is the future’ and to a degree they aren’t wrong (Tampa Bay Rays?). I think the A’s should have and could have been champions using this method IF they were willing to hold onto guys just a little more, and be willing to supplement the roster every once in awhile.

huyjc62,CaptianGeneralKitten,2022-01-30 21:33:20,"Regarding Velarian I feel as though he is the exception to the norm of the custodes. I'm not sure how accurate his assessment of custodes being superior warriors how as opposed to the heresy is as they've taken quite a number of fat Ls.

Off the top of my head,

Battle of lions gate - 2000 dead custodes killed by daemons

That thing with the harlequins which is understandable, harlequins are pretty badass and they didn't have SOS to gimp the shadowseer which I'm sure helped the harleys a lot (especially considering she was the only one to make it to the throneroom and leave alive)

Regent's shadow, Minotaurs took a fat shit on some custodes.

War of the spider! Our Boi fabulous bill gonked a bunch of custodes from Tyvar's shield host. The forces of chaos ""lost"" but bill made off with a bunch of custodes and the custodes got tricked into killing the guys who were trying to kill bill so who really won here? 

But yeah Regarding Velarian I do believe the guy is a wonderful shield captain not because he's an amazing martial combatant or a beast in a fight but because man has common sense! Man is actually thinking through his decisions which is way more than what can be said about 99% of the people in 40K. 

But yeah the reason why I think Velarian is the exception to the norm is because of dudes like Tyvar, the guy infamous of attackin loyalist primaris reinforcements because the chapter they were to be seconded to turned traitor even though they had never met. Like fuck me... I love custodes and I do believe that the brazen drakes should have just surrendered but... fuck that was some peak autism from Tyvar...

Oh yeah and Tyvar walks his men into the most obvious fucking trap set by Bile... So yeah... Tyvar is probably a better fighter than Velarian but damn... man's kinda stupid... 

There's also Nadavarran who's pretty chill and acts as a stealth custodes, man was out in the galaxy doing shady shit and grayfax tried to threaten him once to which he just laughed in her face.

huyl433,nu_lets_learn,2022-01-30 21:50:45,"&gt;Where does it say in the Bible that it's okay to defend yourself?

Many would argue that the right of self-defense is a natural right. In Jewish law, certain scriptural principles are thought to underline the right. For example, Lev. 19:16 says in part, ""do not stand idly by your neighbor's blood."" This is understood to be a bystander's duty to help someone in a dangerous situation, and also a duty to warn someone if you learn of an impending attack against him; presumably the target can take counter-measures in self defense, otherwise the warning would be meaningless (fleeing is one solution, but it may require lethal force to thwart the attack). This leads to an *a fortiori* argument: if I am enjoined to warn my neighbor so he can engage in self-defense, how much more am I entitled to engage in self-defense for myself.

On protecting the home, in Jewish law the relevant verses are Exodus 22:1-2 which at first blush seem a little peculiar: 

""If the thief is seized while tunneling \[under a wall for housebreaking\] and he is killed, there is no bloodguilt in his case. \[But\] If the sun has risen on him, there is bloodguilt in that case."" 

So the general rule (verse 1) is, in the case of breaking and entering while the owner is present, the latter may use force, including lethal force, on the assumption that the housebreaker will not refrain from killing the owner; but there's an exception (verse 2) ""if the sun has risen on him"" -- this is understood as a metaphor, meaning it is clear that the housebreaker did **not** have murderous intent (e.g. a child with no weapon); then the owner may not kill him.

In I Maccabees we read an account of a Jewish group that fled to a cave for safety from the Greek military and were attacked there on the Sabbath day. They refused to fight and were slaughtered: ""So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and cattle, to the number of a thousand persons."" (I Mac. 2:29) From which the Maccabee warriors learned a lesson -- to engage in self-defense even on Sabbath: ""And each said to his neighbor: “If we all do as our brethren have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth.” So they made this decision that day: “Let us fight against every man who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our brethren died in their hiding places.” (I Mac. 2:4041) Incidentally that shows that if it hadn't been the Sabbath day, even the group in the cave would have engaged in self-defense.

A general principle is stated in Deut. 4:15: ""For your own sake, therefore, **be most careful**"" (וְנִשְׁמַרְתֶּ֥ם מְאֹ֖ד לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם). Literally, the Hebrew means ""watch your souls greatly"" -- it means take care of yourself in everyway possible to preserve your life (your soul, *nefesh*). The admonition is understood to encompass things like health care, medicine, treatments, vaccines, blood transfusions -- and self-defense. 

But the point is, self-defense is so obvious it almost doesn't have to be stated; and yet it is, repeatedly.",/r/religion/comments/sgsv4j/where_does_it_say_in_the_bible_that_its_okay_to/huyl433/

Combine that with inflation beginning to bite, costs on the rise, any kind of progressive change happening at a glacial pace (almost certainly to be stopped by the next incoming Nat government before it can gain any momentum) and the absolutely obscene concentration of wealth, power and property being very obviously funneled to the highest earners... yeah I can see why Labour fatigue is setting in.

Is it actually fair?  Well, not really in the grand scheme of things IMO, but that's how politics of the day go.

\-The custodes took vast casualties fighting daemons during the war in the webway as well. Somethine like 90% of their number.  It's hard to say how reasonable to outcome of that battle was because ""88 of Khorne's greatest legions"" is pretty vague.  That could mean each Custodes killed 10,000 daemons or 10!

\-That happened during the War of the Beast, M32.  If anything those custodes are quite likely veterans of the GC and HH!

\-The Custodes were cleaning up those minotaurs.  First engagement, Valerian was toying with a primaris lieutenant to learn more about them.  Second engagement, 4 Custodes fought 10 minotaurs with extra fancy weapons and killed them all with one of them being slain.  And this was the same group of custodes that basically soloed the entire population of a CSM ship in the previous novel IIRC!

\-I agree that Tyvar is incompetent.  However, the War of the Spider involved 18 CSM warbands, 11 cults, swarms of zombies, Bile's augmented warriors, squadrons of daemon engines and a Primarch's flagship against four shield companies (probably 150-300 custodes) and the shield companies won! Their strategic behaviour was extremely poor but it does sound like they dominated every actual fight they were in.  Even Typhus and his guards NOPED out when they came face to face with Custodes!

I agree, Valerian is basically what the lore tells us every Custodes is like, even though we're frequently shown examples to the contrary.  Like Tyvar (the worst commander in the galaxy) and Colquan (the worst diplomat in the galaxy).

To be fair, the Brazen Drakes issue was more because they refused to comply, disarm and be arrested than because of the actual circumstances.  Otherwise the Soul Drinkers probably wouldn't have been remade!

huynrbm,Walk1000Miles,2022-01-30 22:18:02,"All of us that experience living with a chronic illness oftentimes wonder how we make it through from one day to another. 


This articke highlights one woman's journey.

I'm trying to figure out what happened to her, getting a proper diagnosis, and then finding out she had genetic illnesses that were affecting her healing process.



&gt;During any life-changing event, there comes a moment when the fog of the crisis temporarily clears, and you realize with certainty that things will never be the same again.

It's an all-too-common story for those of us who suffer from chronic illnesses, even more than one chronic illness.

&gt;During this leak journey, specialists confirmed that I have two genetic conditions that complicate my prognosis, one affecting the immune system, called Mast Cell Activation Disorder, and the other a heritable connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.


Just like her? Through your research, your journey will take you places you never thought of before. 


You will find about diseases you never even heard of before.

&gt;I had not heard of these conditions prior to my lumbar puncture, and only since researching each one do I better understand how small, seemingly unrelated symptoms actually had common root causes. I have met patients with these conditions who have been trying to get sealed for many years, waiting for science to catch up with their needs.


Sometimes? You even start dreaming again and figure out there might be a future for you besides dealing with chronic illnesses.

&gt;Despite my complicated case, I hope to be able to return to Duke for another patch eventually.


And? At some point? We all realize that sometimes the most we can do is manage our symptoms. 


However? 


We are so far ahead of other people out there who are truly just trying to figure out what is wrong with them and why they're so sick.

&gt;These days, I am managing my symptoms as best I can. I am very limited physically, and my leak symptoms persist. I do get a few hours of ""upright"" time a day, likely due to my body overcompensating by producing extra CSF.


On today? 


My self-care Sunday wish for all of us is that tomorrow is a better day for all of us. For our families and friends. For the people who care for us and make sure that we are okay.


And that? Fearless warriors that we are?


We stick to our goals, our self care regimen, and we get better with the dawn of each day.

Remember? 

When your yellow brick road is no longer yellow?

huyo2xd,conedeke,2022-01-30 22:21:29,"It could be he feels alone.

Does your husband meet with others? Like a kindred? I know a lot of the faith is based on the community.   sometimes its a little too hard to pretend when everyone around holds different gods in their hearts.  

If he does maybe they aren't a good fit, a lot of groups do go bad once they get too much infighting. 

Does he get out into nature much? We do honor the land wights, the spirits of the living earth. It is hard to honor them when not around them. Hunting helps a lot feel the connection especially to gods like Ullr or Skadi.

Does he honor his ancestors anymore? sometimes people don't because they are different faiths then themselves.   But honestly most old people that don't get visits tend to love whoever will give them the time of day to talk and listen.

&amp;#x200B;

An altar could help build some of the connection back up. I haven't seen anything solid as a set way for a norse altar. But basing off of what happens at a blot. Id suggest  a few things.

A Bowl- to mix a drink into after having spoken his prayer or words over and to offer to the earth once done. and to hold water to wash his hands.

A Horn or cup- to hold the drink and speak over. Speaking over mead is sacred as it allows our spirit with those of the spirits and gods and with other speaking over the mead. Though if mead is hard to get or he can't drink ,other drinks could suffice.

A cloth- to dry the hands if you use water to wash your hands before payers or rituals. There are historical precedents for cleaning before prayers and rituals but it also symbolizes cleansing your self as well.

Incense- if he prefers this over washing with water, also cleanses like smudging.

A candle or small fire pot- Fire  helps connect things with spirits. and can put offerings into if you use incense for offerings.  Plus hearth keeping has long been sacred and vital for most of human history.

A sprig of a tree- like a cutting from a tree preferably yew but as long as he isn't allergic to the tree should be fine. To take the mixed drink and sprinkle some of it on him self to share in some of the mixed spirit from speaking over the drink.

A hammer- like mjolnir, though could be a spear head for odin, ect.. helps to connect things and be more norse. There a plenty of historical reasons to have one but sometimes just ascetics for some people.

Effigies- like small statues, carvings, ect of the gods or norse things.  could even be just pictures to start out.  

An altar has a lot of room for personal interpretation and growth as they can always continue to grow and change with us.  It would  be more personal thing,  but it would help to let it be a private place for him and his gods. 

Practicing runes, learning to read and write in them goes a long way for people to feel more connected. And being able to interpret  meanings from a set helps some feel a very deep connection but its oft times something you can do or can't. But always worth a shot to try.

Again a lot of the faith has quite a bit to do with community. So much is based on that and places importance on it. 

 If you don't mind me asking which state are yall in? If its Texas i could see if my kindred can help. We don't reach too much outside of Texas, as Texas is pretty big as it is anyways and quite the handful already. Though we do have good ties to people in some close by states that are just as much family to us as those close by. 

I do know some people over in England that know some people all over Europe, that might know some good people. if your over on the other side of the pond so to speak as well. 

Reading the Eddas and Havamal help alot if he hasn't already. Living by the Havamal defiantly  helps as Odin did leave some good advice on many things he knew would trouble us.  

But some of the bigger concepts that help to understand. There is the belief that everyone has their own Mimir's well and their own tree like Yggdrasil inside them. Our tree soaks in the water below it from the well and droplets based on our actions fall back into that well. So bad things can change that water but can dilute over time by having good things wash that away as time goes by. Think of it like we are all the sum of our experiences but bad things can eventually loose their effect on us as we change from who we were when we did those things.

Also the concept of the Garth. Its like the ring forts back in the day. It has layers. Inside the fort you'd have your house with family and those closest too you, then outside the home your trusted friends and clan.  Then at the walls of that fort you warriors would guard those inside form those outside that layer of trust the unknown ones.  Basically everything has layers of trust and importance. So you taking the interest and trying to help does have precedent and is actually in line with the faith itself.  As your spouse should be your most trusted person.

As much as he feels alone there is a lot to remind him that he isn't ever alone. The land spirits, the people in our lives, our community, the gods.  But likely it would help to talk to other heathens/ asatru / pagans/ ect.",/r/NorsePaganism/comments/sg9jzb/how_can_i_help_my_husband_feel_a_connection_with/huyo2xd/

huyp4rq,BravoMike215,2022-01-30 22:32:57,"1. **For naval,** before unlocking fire arrows, medium bunes beat bow kombaya simply due to archers being higher so kombaya's arrows generally results in less casualities. Medium bunes can also do warcry + boarding action.   
After unlocking fire arrows, 2-3 bow kombaya's fire arrows instantly set a medium kombaya on fire and then generally results in the crew abandoning the ship and jumping abroad as the fire becomes uncontrollable. You can just use faster rowing to run away from medium bunes as your fire arrows are on cooldown. 2 medium bune and 8 fire arrows can generally beat almost everything if you manually battle it.   
Sengoku ships are also good because they have 80 melee crew compared to medium bune's 35 melee crew. But sengoku has a little less crew endurance due to not having warcry. But regardless, with just 2 sengoku bune I once beat 6 bow kombaya and 2 medium bune and 1 sengoku bune when I got attacked by an enemy fleet. Most other ships (excluding siege tower bune) above this weight class is generally not worth it due to how slow they are in the water making  them useless for melee since that's their main job and how long it takes to research them and unlock them or by the time you get them, you are already ruling the waves.  
Autoresolve will generally end up making you lose 6 of your ships against 1 damaged medium bune. So it is generally advised to quick save before autoresolving. Even when not autoresolving, it is advised to quicksave unless u're experienced or playing on legendary or doing a challenge. 
2. **In army compositions**, it depends. Most people use ultra army size where ashigaru bowmen have 160 size while samurai bowmen have 120 size. Anyway, the beauty of Shogun 2 is that even older units are not made obsolete by newer units 80% of the time. The only reason you would phase out the older units is due to limited army size. Ashigaru bows are less accurate and their bows have less penetration so they do worse against better armoured enemies such as samurais and above. But samurai bowmen have lesser men but superior arrow penetration so they will be able to kill samurai armoured units way better but due to having a total of less amount of arrows, they will actually perform worse compared to ashigaru bowmen when firing at inferior ashigaru armour where penetration doesn't matter and hence not only is it a waste of your superior ammunition but also getting less kills than the ashigaru bows against ashigaru spearmen.
3. **All three combinations are possible.** It depends on your funds and the strategy you are going for. Ashigaru have the lowest morale but the highest men. Samurai have better armour, skills (exception is yari samurai facing ashigaru yari wall) and less men. Warrior monks have even less men but exceptional skill but also the armour of an ashigaru. All three social class warriors play differently from each other and this is without considering their weapon type which adds in even more differences and diversity. A nodachi samurai cannot completely replace katana samurai. A naganita samurai cannot completely replace naganita warrior monks. So if you go pure ashigaru, you will have the most fragile in terms of morale and offense but most numerically superior army which can defensively defeat a pure samurai army. Going a pure samurai army is more expensive and less numbers but is often better offense oriented. That is also compounded by the fact that if u could field 12 ashigaru units then when it comes to samurai, with the same money you would only be able to field 10-11 samurai units. This is exacerbated even further by monks.  
**Yari Ashigaru** \- Unbeatable in Yari wall due to spears in front negating enemy charge and having local numerical superiority.  
**Yari Samurai** \- Best anti cavalry infantry in game. Can deny a huge area for cavalry due to having rapid advance ability which makes it the fastest infantry in game. Inferior in melee to katana. Superior in melee to yari ashigaru if ashigaru uses sword for melee due to enemy toto close (no yari wall) but loses if yari ashigaru uses spears (enabled yari wall) because their spears are longer so samurai spears cannot reach ashigaru easily.  
**Yari Cavalry** \- Best charge bonus. Very good anti cavalry bonus. Poor melee skills so cannot do well in sustained combat.  They are also faster than cavalry of other types.  
There is no Katana Ashigaru unless you count a DLC clan's unit which I will not for simplicity.  
**Katana Samurai** \- Very good anti infantry unit that can do very well in sustained melee and is generally what is used to destroy yari walls as long as you are not fighting uphill.  
**Katana Cavalry** \- Best non hero melee stats which should make them the best cavalry. But they are not. The reason being? Almost 70% of the battlefield units happens to be their counter. The yari cavalry and the yari infantry. You could deal with yari infantry by using an anvil to keep the yari infantry preoccupied and using the katana to deliver the hammer. This works but the problem is because of anti cavalry bonus, once the spearmen has taken the charge and some of their friends have died, the spearmen at the rear who haven't died will turn around and start applying their anti cavalry bonus damage against the katana cavalry so it isn't even allowed to do the sustained melee which it is supposed to be good at. But if they fight against sword infantry or bow infantry, they will do very good because of their attack melee skill and superior armour making them even better for charging archers whereas the yari cavalry without cycle charging and staying in sustained combat will start getting far more causalities against sword infantry and bow infantry. Did I mention that spear cavalry are far faster with light cavalry being the fastest and has a 1.25 k/d ratio against katana cavalry and only loses because they have 60 horses compared to katana cavalry's 80 horses. That's katana cavalry victory by only 30/80 alive. So you can see why katana cavalry is in a very tough spot. 
4. **Converting to Christianity,** you get access  to matchlocks which are a very good unit but cannot be used effectively by noobs without watching alot of youtube vids and practice. Being christian also gives you access to missonaries which can easily incite rebellion in enemy provinces because its hard for a religious agent to incite rebellion against same religion. They also get access to european cannons (which CA nerfed the fuck out of so you need mods to make them as good as it was along with mangonels). But they get the second best ship in the game which is the european tradeship as they have cannons as well as matchlocks which allows  them to dominate the trade routes in all of Japan and become more rich. But the downside to it all is that since all of your provinces are buddhists, they will be unhappy until you convert them to above 50% christianity but until then you will get alot of rebellions if you cannot suppress your unhappy population with your army in each and every single one of your provinces. However killing a rebel army will temporarily fix the problem for a few turns until you fix the religion.",/r/shogun2/comments/sgjf5c/chosokabe_campaign_some_newbie_questions/huyp4rq/

We have this idea of enhancing Slayer, and part of it is moving a bunch of the ""useless"" NPCs that have no use outside of Slayer to an instanced ""slaughterhouse."" That's actually a part of a conflict going on in our custom island, which we posted here in this subreddit a few days ago.

Outside, the dungeon to kill NPCs, there hosts a conflict between Guards and various invading NPCs.

2. The Warriors' Guild‎‏‏‎

[https://youtu.be/3d28qKDivzE](Click here to view a video demonstrating the Warriors' Guild.)

Let's be real, the only room most people use are the Animation rooms, the top floor, and the basements. After recognizing this, we decided to size down the Warriors' guild to functionally have these 3 areas.

The Animation room is just as it was before. We're looking into expanding it to have support for dragon armour now that dragon armour is now a full set in OSRS. Why? Because why not!

The top floor and basement Cyclops will be hosted in a newly made dungeon. Functionally, these Cyclops are just as they are in OSRS: a means to get the defenders. We will be expanding the existing Cyclops cave, shown in the image above, to include Lorelei and her higher leveled Cyclops monsters as well.

3. The Abyssal Sire‎‏‏‎

We've been pushing through with Slayer for a while now. We are now at a state where we are making the boss equivalents of the Slayer tasks to allow alternative methods to complete tasks. Right now, the Abyssal Sire - the Abyssal Demon boss - is an example of this in action.

We haven't finished the Sire yet as there is much polishing left to do.

huyqaar,tyrantxrz,2022-01-30 22:45:42,"Hello there! I played this comp to glad this season with a disc priest who played both venthyr and night fae. Contrary to that other post below you're perfectly fine running night fae as this comp - it will allow you to beat comps like rmp and ret/warr with rsham/druid far more consistently than venthyr priest which really doesn't provide that extra degree of dampener/cd trading that night fae does. You also really don't need mindgames to land kills here - ret warrior hasn't needed that for a very long time.

Now, you're looking for help vs. spriest warr. The thing I can tell you is that this is probably your hardest matchup outside certain affliction warlock teams. If the opposing warrior is kyrian he will consistently land double spears and if the opposing priest is any good he'll drop psyfiend and unholy nova afterwards to just melt the two of you while your healer struggles.  To me, there's two important things to consider - as ret warrior you want to hit the same target together and keep momentum and during the spear you have a moment where you're not doing damage or have no uptime. This is what you need to diffuse. I think what is key to surviving this moment in the matchup is to prioritize killing psyfiend on these setups but also looking to turn pressure onto the warrior.

You have to treat the spear as an offensive cd and react to it - that's on the warrior and healer more than the ret during these setups, but you have the tools to react as well if you're not focused and can provide support through sac. You have to turn pressure as quickly as possible in this scenario and go for the warrior's jugular while he's got you both locked down. The good thing is if the warrior is in the spear you can turn pressure on him quickly if your warrior trades intervene/parry. Even with that the opposing warrior will WANT to be there for the crit damage buff. If the warrior is not in there, then it's a good sign because you've still got most of the momentum and the priest/psyfiend/purges/clones (depending on healer) are where all the pressure are coming from for your healer - that's something you can take care of with a judgement or blade of justice (unfortunately throw weapon no longer one shots psyfiends :X).  

So for some specific tips: Against the rdruid version of spriest/warr you want to be swapping on hots, a good moment for this is when the opposing warrior intervenes the priest - it's likely that he's not hotted and will take ridiculous damage, especially since a lot of cocky kyrian warriors will stay battle - as mentioned a very good opportunity to turn the pressure and force parry or d-stance. Against both the rsham and rdruid versions of the comp you can also look to go healer, though with a kyrian warrior on the other team it will be much harder. With rdruids in particular the key to pressure them is by swapping around hots, with rshams it's landing your setups and to an extent getting lucky off a good setup. With a night fae priest you should also have an off-cycle wings that will give you a ton of pressure if you land a double cc - the only thing to consider here is that you will be off cycle on your own cd end for wings/banner until the 6 minute mark. 

As for your questions - judgements of the pure is invaluable into this matchup but it can backfire if you're not careful when you dispel. I would roll battlemasters in virtually every matchup as ret paladin so that's definitely the play there. It's also worth (imo) picking up eye for an eye as the warrior is the one that's going to be dealing the critical damage that will put them ahead during the spear, the priest is going to do redic damage anyway and while having a shorter cd on bubble/sov is nice I don't think it's as high value since both priest and warr can break the bubble. 

For your warrior - he can intervene parry on the first spear if you need to reduce pressure, it has the added bonus of stopping the buffed crits from the warrior and will let you reduce dam from their cds. Your priest can dome the next spear with a ret sac on the warrior. Your warrior should also always disarm warbreaker - there's no excuse not to as they have the same cd, it will be up every time. The way I kit out into this matchup is typically sharpen, disarm and warbringer.  My personal advice to any warrior is to read the game, pay attention to the other team's offensive cds and run a tally of what they're using, what your team has used and how best to disrupt their cds or defend your team using yours. A good warrior should have the mindset of managing the teams health just like a healer does, albeit through his cds rather than heals.

A last option for you as the ret that I would consider but not go all in on if you're not comfortable with is to pick up necrolord ret with duty bound gavel- it's really solid and has insane pressure into warriors and priests as double vanq hammer with double buffs lets you hit priests hard off the greater fade/trinket cycle. That's more of a comfort thing but I do think it will be the meta for the comp next patch as you'll be able to have both final verdict and gavel.

Bottom line - don't tunnel one target  as ret/warr. Look for opportunities to swap around, play aggressively but also cautiously as the opposing team has the means to punish you for stacking. Be aggressive but patient, you can win every matchup as long as you trade right :)",/r/worldofpvp/comments/sgsnc5/retwarriordisc_2200_need_some_advice_on_dealing/huyqaar/

Frenzy will make mobs spawn faster than we can clear them as we move through the map, this isnt even a bad thing as this means that you will always have mobs to kill and it will not hurt your rates, at least comparable to you leveling a Bowmaster or marksman. I reached level 250 in about a month when the class first came out, getting to Arcana and then moving on to Sellas at 245 was smooth, after 250 you hit that very hard climb from 250 to 255 at SSS1 or Vc3 and then once you move on to 1-5 you will continue to have mediocre rates but you can definitely earn more than frenzy costs and can continue to earn mesos while you grind.

That's reserves.  National Guard is constantly working, way more than 1 weekend a month.  I know guys who spend their entire 6 year enlistment supporting an active duty unit.

To your scenario, the guard has special forces, quick reaction forces, and air defense.  For one, Russia wouldn't attack us on home soil, other than with nukes, which would be pointless.  Aerial strikes wouldn't make it past the air guard.

&gt;Not everyone benefits from police OR fire departments.

Yes, whether you've had to use them or not, you benefit from them.

&gt;Not government land or property, which is the point.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Lol our economy was deeply intertwined with slaves.

Every economy was.  That's the point.  From the beginning of time, there has been a slave trade.  America was a speck in the ocean.

&gt;The wealthy own businesses those businesses cause drains on society, and those drains are paid for by higher taxes. An individual drives a car, a business drives a fleet of trucks. Those trucks then pollute, and that polkution causes health issues, which then drain medicare.

Businesses have their own taxes.  Why does a rich person, say, a doctor have to pay more than you in taxes?

The fleet pays for gas. Gas is taxed. The owner of those trucks abides by emission standards.  Medicare is a sham.

&gt;Business owners pay less than living wages.

The government has a minimum on what you can pay, and it is a livable wage.

&gt;The leaders of the GOP are absolutely rich.

All politicians eventually become rich.

&gt;They're ABSOLUTELY just trying to seize power to further their fortunes.

That's a bold claim.  I see them being pretty passionate about just wrestling power away from crazy democrats, but if you have evidence that their plan is to further their fortunes, I'd be glad to peruse.

Owl was there when Grisha went outside the Eldian zone. Owl sent Grice and Dina to Grisha's side and was responsible for him joining the restorationists. Then Owl was there yet again at 'Heaven' to save Grisha. Owl seemingly had every turning point of Grisha's life entirely mapped out, hell he even brought the picture to give Grisha to convince him at the same time because he knew he'd argue. There's no way for that to be Eren's PoV because you can't have a Future Memory of a Memory (the exclusion being the FT with this latest episode because Eren went inside the memories). Plus how would Eren's memories even help some of the more ancient AT holders? Them knowing about Grisha or Kruger wouldn't matter at all if it was 1400 years ago since it's not pertinent to their own survival or what they need to accomplish to create the conditions for Grisha/Kruger/Dina/everyone to be born and exist. Owl points out how all of Grisha's life could've been different with just the smallest change- Grisha not breaking the law and leaving the Eldian Zone- no Zeke, no marriage to Dina, no marriage to Carla, and no Eren. Because of how precise it is, it only makes sense that for THAT long (2000 years) it would have to be predetermined to have the AT fall into Eren's hands.


And if you wanna go with the argument that Eren could just do xyz with the FT, then there's no point to any of this. Any plot hole or inconvenience could just be explained with Eren having done it off-screen.

imo, there's no team that could beat the suns (except the warriors) before that conf finals, even the grizzlies, nuggets at best its a 4-2 loss, mavs... they usually just chokes on a good team in the playoffs who isnt the clippers, the rest arent even worth mentioning would be nice if they upset the suns tho. with that said im still betting on the suns not winning the ring, cp3 is just such a bitch that it overtrumps his godliness being a point guard.

I think it was the 2017 title that Kawhi was single-handedly pushing GSW's shit in before they pulled a filthy move that took him, and effectively San Antonio's chances of winning, outta the series.

--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|1|1972 Suns|49|33|4.7|
|2|2014 Timberwolves|40|42|2.7|
|3|2001 Rockets|45|37|2.6|
|4|2014 Suns|48|34|2.6|

|6|2015 Thunder|45|37|2.5|

|8|1997 Cavaliers|42|40|2.2|
|9|1979 Bucks|38|44|2.1|
|10|2008 Warriors|48|34|2.0|


But that doesn't quite tell us what we want to know as a lot of good teams have missed the playoffs in the past. Let's see what the best net ratings are with a losing record:

|Rk|Team|Wins|Losses|NRtg|
--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|1|1959 Nationals|35|37|3.4|

|9|1996 Bullets|39|43|1.1|
|10|1958 Knicks|35|37|1.1|
