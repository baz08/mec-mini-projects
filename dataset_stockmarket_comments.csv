It's not about owning the means of production to be fanciful. The POINT of owning the means of production (or seizing them if you're a filthy communist) is that the resources would be more fairly dispersed.

Dumping large amounts of cash doesn't eliminate unemployment or homelessness.  Expanding the economy, support for new businesses, good education, and low/reasonable taxation does promote employment.  Chronic homelessness is generally a mental health or drug/alcohol abuse problem.  Cities with very expensive housing are generally over regulated preventing new housing stock or housing stock that isn't single family with large yards.  

These are topics I am concerned about and unfortunately many people have taken the attitude it's either run around without a mask to show your freedom, or not locking down is going to kill every last grandma.

ghorila,imunfair,2021-01-01 00:12:55,"Yes because it's much higher risk for decreasing leverage the more you overpay for them. 

I like 5:1 to 10:1 plays and if you start opening warrants at $2 you're looking at maybe 3:1 in a typical scenario and only if you get in right at the start which is ridiculously low.  I can do better than that on low-cap stock plays with less risk.

Of course the idiots paying $2-4 for a pre-target warrant are thinking the $10 spac is gonna go 5x and they'll get like 20:1, because they don't realize that type of rise is both rare, and that warrants start lagging so even if the spac goes 5x they'll end up at 10:1 at best, 5:1 if they were stupid and paid $4. 

If that happened they could have gotten the same 5:1 just holding commons, it would have been way less risky for the same return.

That's why they're idiots though, they're playing a one-trick game where they don't understand the risk and get wiped out when the one trick eventually doesn't work.",/r/SPACs/comments/ko38kt/the_state_of_spac_investors/ghorila/

ghoshgk,Knightwriter2010,2021-01-01 00:30:52,"Jake was... new... to the stock room, and had difficulty getting used to the work. Not just with the borderline  non-existent organization of the place, but also with some of the more basic tasks.

This wasn't surprising, he was not the stocky type. He still cut a fairly athletic figure, but more lithe and thin than bulky. He could not have had more than 100 lbs on his 5 ft, 8in frame; and the tight clothes he preferred to wear made it obvious that lifting was not his exercise of choice.

Not that that was unappealing. His figure, combined with blond hair that was too long for the regular guy but very short for a girl, dark brown eyes, and hairless face made it easy for me forget that he was, well, a *he* fairly often.

His sense of humor and easy going nature also made him easy to work with,  so I helped him out as often as I could and let him know that I'd be happy to help any time with any thing, both inside work and outside.

He tapped me on the shoulder one day at the end of work and said he did need some help. His car had broken down that morning and he needed a lift home.  I had never been to his place before, but I agreed to give him a lift in my truck. It was fortunate for him, as it was pouring outside, but we both still got soaked crossing the parking lot to get to the truck. I was still dripping wet when we got to his apartment.

""I can't let you go  this wet!"" He said as I pulled into his apartment's parking lot ""Come on up and dry off for a bit before going home.""

I didn't need to,  I  felt perfectly fine,  but for reasons I still don't entirely understand I agreed and went up to his place.

It was a small apartment, bare-bones one bed and living room kind of deal. He went into his bathroom to fetch so.e towels and told me to make myself comfortable. I took a beer out of his fridge and waited for him to come back out.

He brought out the towels,  gave one to me, placed another on the sofa, and grabbed a beer himself. We both sat on the sofa and he turned on the TV. Without thinking I put my arm on the back of the sofa, behind him.

""There's... another thing I wanted some help with."" He said after a little bit, his voice was pensive, as if afraid of what my reactions might be.

""What is it?"" I asked.

""I'm, well, I don't know how to even say it..."" he said.

""With words."" I quipped, making him chuckle.

""Okay,  jackass,"" he said through the laughs ""with words... I'm in need of some company, of a specific kind. Have you ever been into... guys?""

I was silent for a bit. The answer, of course,  was yes; but I'm bisexual, hetero-romantic, and I'm *definitely* not very public with my preferences. Not because I'm afraid of repercussions, just because that aspect of my life doesn't have as much say in my identity as it does to a lot of other people. Truth be told, if I could make myself asexual intentionally I'd do it.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, my hormones do still have sway. The turn in the conversion made said hormones divert blood flow from my brain to my cock and as it began to grow to its thick, 7 erect inches, my IQ began to fade as well.

""Um... yes, but only occasionally...""

Jake noticed my growing member, he began to rub it through my jeans. ""Is this one of those occasions?""

""Uh-ha"" I grunted as I began to lose myself 3those brown eyes.

His next words were breathy, and barely above a whisper.

""I need you to fuck me... can you please?""

I answered by pulling his mouth to  mine and kissing him deeply. Our tongues played over each other as my other hand began to explore his body; caressing his chin, neck, and tight but skinny body. His hands similarly explored, but focused on where my pants strained against my member.

We broke the kiss long enough for air and to remove our shirts, then moved to his bedroom. We bounced off of walls and furniture on the way and lost  clothing in route. By the time we were on his bed our pants were gone.

He was wearing a *thong* black and lacy, perfectly displaying his cute little ass.

I turned him on to his back and kissed him again,  playing with his nipples and working my way down. My mouth followed my hands on their decent until I was at his panty line.

I pulled the thong down to reveal an erect average sized penis. I  kissed it softly and looked up at him. His surprised face was all I needed. I liked the shaft while cupping his balls, then took the head in my mouth and began trying to deep throat it. His surprised and pleasure filled gasps gave me encouragement, but I didn't work him all the way yet.

I gripped his cock in my hand and moved back up to kis him again.  ""You want to be my bitch?"" I asked aggressively. He moaned and nodded. ""You want to be my slut?!"" I  asked again and received the same nod and moan.

I cupped his balls and squeezed slightly, getting a y little yelp from him. ""Say it!"" I  demanded.

""Please sir, fuck me! Please make me your bitch!""

I flipped him over and pulled his hips back. From this angle he looked particularly feminine and vulnerable.

""Where is your lube and condoms?"" I asked. He pulled a bottle out of his nightstand.

""I'm clean, please fuck raw."" He begged.

""And if I'm not?"" I demanded. I was, and still am,  but it's still important to ask.

""I'm your slut! I deserve whatever you give me.""

""Fine!"" I said and slapped his ass. He groaned.

I squirted lube on his tight, pink, asshole and on the tip of my dick. I toyed with his hole while rubbing his back for a little while. Then grabbed his hips and began to thrust. He gasped in pain and pleasure as I entered him and began to fuck.  Slowly at first, then building up speed as his body began to accommodate me.

He was *tight!*, ultimately too tight for me as I didn't cum after nearly an hour of screwing. Jake, on the other hand,  definitely *did*, at least twice where he ejaculated onto his bed, and maybe several other times after that. He never touched his own cock during our time that afternoon.

Eventually we both collapsed onto his bed, exhausted and spent. Him in his own pile of goo, and me beside him. After a little while we went into the shower his apartment had, and  I let him return the favor regarding the blowtorch after I cleaned my dick. His mouth finished me off and he swallowed.

The rain had stopped, so after cleaning off I departed for my place.

Now, somewhere between once a week and once a month he has ""car troubles"" and I end up taking him home. I always say ""Gass, Cas, or Ass?"" And he responds with ""definitely one of those things.""

Nobody has noticed that he walks a little strangely the next day when he is suddenly  able to drive into work.",/r/DirtyWritingPrompts/comments/knubf9/wp_you_told_the_cute_trappy_new_guy_at_work_that/ghoshgk/

Personally, I wouldn't go with another complimentary IEM for the M9. Now that you understand how much technical performance can matter to your enjoyment, I don't think you'll easily find another IEM that ""presents"" in the same way as the M9. Instead, I would just EQ for vocals, and thankfully, it's fairly easy to do. If you know how to use PEQ, set up a 3 kHz bump of about 2-3 kHz. If you use GEQ (e.g. most stock EQs), find the one closest to 3 kHz (probably the 4 kHz) and bump it 2-3 dB. Adjust to your liking.

I was finally able to locate a competitor to have some idea of the market. The Siemens IMMULITE, apparently.  I don't know anything about medical instrumentation, but I understand what dynamic range is.  Hyperthyroidism is an imbalance of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).   Zomedica's machine apparently has way better dynamic range which amounts to better accuracy overall detecting TSH levels, to the point that if I'm reading correctly they're saying their machine can be used for feline testing which is apparently hard on some level..and currently not commercially available (only for dogs right now, I guess).  It may also be the first/only point-of-care ft4(thyroid hormone) assay and I don't know how big that is or isn't, but I certainly like hearing that companies that I have stock in have toys that don't otherwise exist.",/r/pennystocks/comments/knxwbd/zom_in_for_1000_shares_because_its_a_company_i/ghoszz1/

ghotaka,ScorpiaHP,2021-01-01 00:46:10,"In an ideal world for us, maybe, but I think he'd just want a move away at that point. He's too good to be no2. I do think the club will already be looking at a long term replacement. Like they did when they signed a 19 year old Courtois in 2011 (when Cech entered his 30s) and loaned him out for 3 years. 

Happy with Mendy as no1 for the foreseeable future, but we do need to sign a good backup for him. Someone like Dubravka or Darlow would be ideal (can't decide which of the two is more valuable to Newcastle but both of them are starting quality shot stoppers atleast). Hopefully Kepa can get a loan in the summer and quietly build his stock back up so a Spanish club is willing to take him off our hands.",/r/soccer/comments/kny97f/daily_discussion/ghotaka/

Where and to whom? I went to a store on launch day 6 hours before opening and didnt get one. The store got 10 cards on launch and according to employees they haven't seen any AMD cards since but they sporadically get RTX 30 series here and there. 

After that fiasco I had to have myself and 2 others constantly scour the internet around the clock to get an RX 6800 more than a month later. Even then I had to pay a premium for it when I grabbed one on a drop on Newegg. Was never able to find an RX 6800XT or RTX 3080 in stock that I could actually get into a cart online or IRL.

ghou7d1,lead999x,2021-01-01 01:03:56,"&gt;You know that there are tens of thousands of these cards being sold every month right?

Where and to whom? I went to a store on launch day 6 hours before opening and didnt get one. The store got 10 cards on launch and according to employees they haven't seen any AMD cards since but they sporadically get RTX 30 series here and there.

ghou7mv,HellOfAHeart,2021-01-01 01:04:05,"hmmm yes - all this sounds great, wont work in theory though and its a very simple problem

Weight and Encumbrance.

Look at it like this, Your guy MUST dress to survive the freezing cold. That means adequate clothing is a compulsory need. He MUST dress in Antarctic-level of clothes, that means thick jackets, double layers of under clothes, balaclava, scarf and all that.

Now - This means hes going to be not so agile, hes going to be ALREADY on the heavy side.

The second problem then, comes with armour - I assume you want him to have some sort of protection yes? Well Kevlar and plates arent light, theyre real fucking heavy, add that to the mix hes even heavier, even LESS agile AND there is the problem of where hes going to slot the plates in. He'll need a vest of course - but where will he put it? Logically it would be the underlayer closest to his chest, well how will he get to it to slot plates in? Unzip everything?

[Dressing for Antarctica - relevant clothing guide](https://travelwild.com/resource-pages/antarctica/dressing-for-your-antarctica-cruise/)

So then, Armour plating and Kevlar - extremely tricky and unfeasible, but it ""could"" work theoretically.

&amp;#x200B;

Next you have his carrying capacity - naturally you want him to have a big fuck off Alice pack right? So he can carry all his essentials with him.

Of course you can guess where Im going with this ayy - that will be very heavy. However, he MUST carry all that, he is a 1 man army, so he must carry all to help him survive.

Unless he had transport, ie a bike or vehicle that could help to alleviate the weight problem by carrying shit for him - then he has big fucking problem in the next section.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons:  
This isnt  a video game, He's not gonna be carrying around such an arsenal of weapons, where would he find them? And even so, how would he use them?  


Fuck it, M249 SAW - The machine gun you want - first off thats biiiig fucking heavy, an ordinary soldier has their work cutout for them carrying a SAW, more then that - that soldier would work in tandem with at least 2 other rifleman to carry spare link (ammo).  
In short - your guy cant carry it, AND he cant hold the spare link even if he could find a way to get enough of it (A SAW fires 100 rounds per minute at sustained firing, 200/min at a rapid rate - he cant afford that)  


Well thats the big gun gone, By longer range I assume you want a sniper rifle right?  
The coolest of the cool - well guess what, sorry to shatter you're dreams but that aint feasible either.

As I said, this aint COD - A sniper/marksman trains for years, and trains specifically to be able to fire such a powerful rifle - he has to take into account wind, distance and a multitude of other factors - that means he cant be moving around all the time, he HAS to have a nest. More then that he MUST have a spotter, a friendly helper to watch his back and spot targets for him. - Now your guy wont have that, he'll be on his own. Thats assuming hes even trained to fire such a weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

Shotguns, pistols and rifles:  
You're in luck here, Depending on what select rifle, shot gun or pistol he has - They arent so heavy that its not feasible to carry them, nor are they requiring in depth training to use at all.

Ideally I think you COULD get away with a higher caliber rifle (that means AK or M4, I think suitable for ranges of roughly 300m). Shotgun - probably he would find a hunting shotgun right? Theyre longer range then you think, but hes not gonna find a Spas-12 lying about. A pistol is fine, any pistol he can find as long as he has the ammo for all.

Biggest problem after weight/encumbrance is finding the weapons in the first place, military grade hardware wont be lying around, and then finding enough ammo to keep him in stock. That problem is in your hands though.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Your guys gonna be way too fat and heavy, over-encumbered and slow

Make some hard and fast choices about what he can realistically carry, and be prepared to sacrifice tacticool for staying warm and alive.

ghovb5i,LazyMoneyGame,2021-01-01 01:23:39,"&gt;Congratulations!  
&gt;  
&gt;I hold a handful of the same companies as you do and look forward to see how they do next year. (JPM, O, VZ, ABBV). And you've introduced me to some more that I'll look into, for that I thank you.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a few questions,  
&gt;  
&gt;What's your favourite stock in your portfolio and why?Why do you hold both JPM and BAC, opposed to just one? Do you favour one over the other? Or hold both for diversification sake?What are your future plans with your oil companies SU, XOM? Do you see them transitioning? Or perhaps you think they have many good years ahead of them?  
&gt;  
&gt;I know I've asked alot and haven't provided much value myself, please don't misunderstand I'm not questioning you because I disagree. I'm asking because I hope to be at the position you are in a few years and wish to learn.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again congratulations, and happy new year!

  

Thanks, happy to share what I have been doing, and hopefully inspire others, or at least introduce them to some stocks they didn´t know.

1. That is a though question since. But If I could only pick one company in my portfolio, I would choose STORE Capital

Best CEO I have seen and a really well managed company.  
To me they have perfected making the risk on high cap rate acquisitions to near zero since they have intimate knowledge of tenant financials. It is a solid and business model that was only interrupted by Covid-19. They don't rely on old networks, either. They run a cold calling operation looking for tenants to buy their real estate from, which will be very productive from this awful year onwards.

They are a really flexible company.

So classically, high cap rates mean high yields on rents. Typically, this is seen as higher risk, higher reward, higher losses. STOR requires their tenants to report their financial situation to them. They select for profit centers which tenants would be reluctant to let go of in terms of leasing. This reduces risk.

They also work closely with tenants in times of need, as we have seen with Covid-19. They worked closely with tenants to make sure they were okay and gave them rent relief. That is very rare. They are now at over 90% rents collected in Q4 despite leasing to zero investment grade tenants.

2. Why do you hold both JPM and BAC, opposed to just one? Do you favor one over the other? Or hold both for diversification sake?

I simply like both companies, I started with building my position in BAC, and wanted to have JPM as well. With the resend $30B buyback announcement from JPM it´s hard not to like stock. I don´t really have a favorite, I am still puzzled about why Buffet prefers BAC over JPM. 

3. What are your future plans with your oil companies SU, XOM? Do you see them transitioning? Or perhaps you think they have many good years ahead of them?

I think that oil will be here for some decades so I still plan to hold them, they are by no means major positions in my portfolio, but I would like to have some exposure to that sector for now.

Well sometimes we ask questions other times we provide answers. I am just happy to add back to the community, so in my mind you are doing the right thing. 

Happy new year",/r/dividends/comments/knawt1/just_hit_2000_for_2020/ghovb5i/

ghovd83,a_stray_ally_cat,2021-01-01 01:24:26,"The op ""advice"" sounds like a mega whale who refresh everyday. 
You won't have any exp for your artifact if you keep every 5*, and you should be happy with just a good MAIN stat + 1/2 ok sub stat. Don't even bother trying this 4 sub stat crap, you won't ever find the perfect artifact unless you are p2w whale. 

Its more important to lvl 16 all your half decent artifacts (again just good main stat) and fill your team. A team of half decent artifacts &gt;&gt; 1 dps with good artifact. Try farming for artifacts domain where both sets are useful for your team first. Ex. noblest domain also drop physical set, so if you have say razor + bennet do that one first. Leave the dps-only artifacts last, like the crimson witch, they offer the least value, your diluc or w/e can do perfectly fine with glad + w/e you accumulated along the way (which are likely quite good stat wise since you had the whole game to pick/select), trying to find similar ones as crimson witch set will take a TON of resources, so much so you may be out of resin and leaving the rest of your party dry (remember you need 2 parties)

Elemental globe should be the ""off"" piece by default. It is the most difficult to find (matching element) so keep every 5* elemental dmg% globe you find, regardless of set, you will most likely need one sooner or later.

Again remember your resin stock is very limited. You can ALWAYS gear your party first then go back and focus on perfecting a single dps with remaining resin ... but not the other way around.",/r/GenshinImpactTips/comments/ko7oab/here_are_some_advanced_tips_on_how_to_make_the/ghovd83/

I feel this is where you're going to find the causative factor: piling money into asset markets causes asset price inflation. Whodathunkit. If you look at the mechanics behind QE and what it is supposed to achieve, you'll see this is entirely by design: inflate the asset prices so their relative returns are shithouse, to push yield-seekers into riskier assets. Flows (dividends, interest bearing instruments like savings accounts and term deposits, etc.) are out, capital gains are in baby! Such cheap money also means there's a deluge available for expensive fun times like stock buybacks, mergers and acquisitions (which benefits the well-established big players) and all that shenanigans that pumps stock prices.

The rich get richer (on paper) since they own most of the assets, but if you happen to have some investments of your own (and nearly all of us have superannuation), then those would benefit from this activity as well.

I have the Monoprice Maker Select v2 now for around a month. 
So far (after a few basic upgrades, see Mosfet Power Board and Diii-Cooler, etc.) it is going great, although it is my very first printer and i didn‘t have any prior knowledge.
I have heard people suggesting to go with an Ender 3, because with the Maker Select you have manually level your bed and whatnot, which can be quite the hassle tbh.
For prints not sticking: with the stock print surface i rather had the problem of getting the print off of the surface afterwards haha

Just keep in mind that with pretty much every 3D-printer, it is mostly not plug-and-play! You will always have some setbacks, but with time you learn to tweak some settings, calibrate the bed, etc.
Anyways, don‘t forget the fun of it and happy printing! :)",/r/3Dprinting/comments/ko88mc/can_the_monoprice_maker_select_v2_be_a_good/ghovw7d/

ghovyes,_sillycibin_,2021-01-01 01:33:47,"Wow, you've got to change your time perspective.  Presumably you bought LEAPS and you chose PLTR because you believe in the long term prospects of the stock.  Do you believe in it?  If so then chill out.  Because even good stocks will do this.  Plus technically PLTR had a pretty fierce runup.  Didn't it IPO at $10?  So it's actually up 250% or so.  Are you investing or trading?  Are you actually just trying to trade PLTR short term and you got LEAPS as what?  some sort of ""insurance"" in case it doesn't make a brisk move up in the short term or even as we've seen... go down?  In which case your insurance was to set it aside, look away for a while, and come back in a month or two and see where it's at.  Especially after earnings.  

I try to never buy monthlies anymore.  Out of every 5 I buy probably 3 end up total losses.  1 will break even or partial loss.  And 1 will get me some nice profits but often not enough to make up for the losses.  So I pick stocks that I truly believe in long term and buy leaps or at least 6 months out.  Earnings are coming up in February which is actually really soon.  So for example I think WMT is choice for an earnings play.  Look how beaten down it is.  Everytime between earnings it looks like daytraders just pound it down and then boom it skies up and then erodes down.  But look at the 1 year and 5 year charts.  Reliable gainer.  And given all the drastic changes that seem to be working.  I'm pretty bullish on it.",/r/options/comments/knd67y/went_heavy_in_pltr_leaps_paying_for_it_now/ghovyes/

For once, Intel will update their lineup in the next few months (amd just dropped the latest rayzens, thats why rn they seem way more powerful, they are just newer). As a developer myself, I can tell you Intel's stability isn't matched by ryzen, it just isn't. In terms of drivers, emulation, etc. For the last 3/4 years amd offered something SLIGHTLY more powerful than intel, but everything just works with intel. I know a lot of close people that switched to amd for professional reasons and even though they had more raw power, the system just wasn't as stable. I'm not saying your pc wont boot up or will randomly reboot, I mean its just way way way more likely to find drivers that just wont work properly on amd and it will give you some headaches. In terms of performance, if we dont look at ryzens 5000 series, amd was just slightly more powerful besides artificial benchmarks, you will get more or less the exact same power for the money. Can amd win on a random read write or compression test? Sure, do you feel a huge difference compared to intel on a daily basis? Not at all. Ryzen 5000s I wouldn't compare to current intels, so rn ryzens are better in terms of power. When intel lunches 11th gen they will be prettt much matched. If you spend 500€ on your cpu chances are both intel and amd will offer you a cpu that will give you enough power to work the way you want to. 
I would recommend you to wait until intel announces and we see prices (because you cant buy ryzens 5000 bc of stock atm) and then decide. 
No company will let you down, Amd started making powerful budget cpus 5 years ago and Intel has to catch up making more powerful budget cpus, now they are mostly even so it's okay",/r/ableton/comments/ko6t2y/is_the_amd_performance_better_than_intel_even_in/ghow37w/

Definitely open the controller and remove the stick cap before applying glue. One stray drop of the strong stuff will leave a scar on that shell.

ghox6q5,Whatasadsub,2021-01-01 01:49:32,"Well then perhaps regulations should be in place to ensure house prices are not increasing 5-15% a year because of a lack of housing construction.

You do realise that the main issue is that the vast majority of people are home owners and are extremely comfortable seeing their house price increase continuously. It's literally like a safe stock option for the majority of citizens. 

Here in NZ the issue is not migration or refugees it's the lack of building consent, tax regulations and house price increases that are not even reflecting the actual reality.

We had next to zero net migration this year yet house prices still rose exorbitantly. This is not a supply and demand issue as you suggest. This is a purposefully constructed (excuse the pun) housing market to allow the vast majority of citizens who are home owners - a place to invest their money through home ownership. 


This is excluding the fact that a majority of home owners own more than 2 or 3 homes. Further decreasing the availability and access for first time home owners to even find a place. Put in place deposit requirements that most aged 25-35 don't really have and you have an issue where available houses can't even be purchased by working class middle income families, let alone refugees that you're blaming all the problems on.

ghox7pn,sometipsygnostalgic,2021-01-01 01:49:52,"Yes. The way shows are written has changed dramatically due to binge watching. 

Here is a case study example:  
Back in 2014, Cartoon Network started releasing episodes in ""bombs"". It did this first with ""Steven Universe"" and ""Adventure Time"". 

CN then abandoned the weekly airing schedule of both shows, only airing ""bombs"" of episodes every few months, with the occasional return of weekly airing. The bombs could air all on the same day, or across a single week. 

Steven Universe decided to rewrite their episodes so that they worked in a bomb format. The rest of the show heavily featured 5 episode ""stevenbombs"", each with their own name and promotional effort. This worked very well under the new format, but it drastically changed how the crew approached each episode. 

Adventure Time puts lots of stock into its single episode short stories, so it initially struggled under the new format. Executives producer Adam Muto put forward the idea of making ""miniseries"", blocks of episodes connected to a single story arc, but these were longer and more cohesive than the Stevenbombs, able to be sold as standalone packages while connecting heavily to the larger series lore. 

Adventure Time's miniseries format did quite well, but the show suffered enormous hiatuses. The non miniseries content would continue to air as bombs, and the eps gained a heavy continuity to compensate for this - five episode plot points, usually. 

When the series went off air for nearly a whole year prior to its finale, it got no advertisement and many kids forgot it existed. 

Adam Muto knew the binge format was its most successful under CN's new schedule, so he put forward ideas for multiple miniseries - one based on BMO, one based on Marceline and Bubblegum... do you see where I'm going with this? Anyway, CN cancelled the show instead of taking on his miniseries ideas, but they were picked up by HBO Max instead. They are half the length of the other miniseries but they are airing as fully cohesive standalone movies instead, once again taking place during the series and featuring characters from it, but not depending on your previous knowledge. 

They are sadly only being released once every half year, so it's not like they can be treated as a single season.",/r/television/comments/ko8i7k/tv_concepts_weekly_episodes_vs_binge_watching/ghox7pn/

They are sadly only being released once every half year, so it's not like they can be treated as a single season.",/r/television/comments/ko8i7k/tv_concepts_weekly_episodes_vs_binge_watching/ghox7pn/
ghox7pn,sometipsygnostalgic,2021-01-01 01:49:52,"Yes. The way shows are written has changed dramatically due to binge watching. 

Here is a case study example:  
Back in 2014, Cartoon Network started releasing episodes in ""bombs"". It did this first with ""Steven Universe"" and ""Adventure Time"". 

CN then abandoned the weekly airing schedule of both shows, only airing ""bombs"" of episodes every few months, with the occasional return of weekly airing. The bombs could air all on the same day, or across a single week. 

Steven Universe decided to rewrite their episodes so that they worked in a bomb format. The rest of the show heavily featured 5 episode ""stevenbombs"", each with their own name and promotional effort. This worked very well under the new format, but it drastically changed how the crew approached each episode. 

Adventure Time puts lots of stock into its single episode short stories, so it initially struggled under the new format. Executives producer Adam Muto put forward the idea of making ""miniseries"", blocks of episodes connected to a single story arc, but these were longer and more cohesive than the Stevenbombs, able to be sold as standalone packages while connecting heavily to the larger series lore. 

Adventure Time's miniseries format did quite well, but the show suffered enormous hiatuses. The non miniseries content would continue to air as bombs, and the eps gained a heavy continuity to compensate for this - five episode plot points, usually. 

When the series went off air for nearly a whole year prior to its finale, it got no advertisement and many kids forgot it existed. 

Adam Muto knew the binge format was its most successful under CN's new schedule, so he put forward ideas for multiple miniseries - one based on BMO, one based on Marceline and Bubblegum... do you see where I'm going with this? Anyway, CN cancelled the show instead of taking on his miniseries ideas, but they were picked up by HBO Max instead. They are half the length of the other miniseries but they are airing as fully cohesive standalone movies instead, once again taking place during the series and featuring characters from it, but not depending on your previous knowledge.
