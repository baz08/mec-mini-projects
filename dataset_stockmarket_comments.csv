ghpbjna,mcoclegendary,2021-01-01 04:05:21,"TDOC is my largest US position. Telehealth is an industry I only see increasing (especially in the US) and TDOC is best poised to capture it. Simple as that.

The stock has been (maybe unfairly) punished as a result of the LVGO merger. Most people are waiting on the next ER to see how successful the integration is. If all is well, TDOC will soar. If not, stock will be in the dumps for awhile. My general thought is that LVGO has great synergies with TDOC.

Sure Amazon says they want to enter telehealth. Who wouldn’t? It’s going to be a booming industry. Yes maybe some caution is warranted but I would point out two things. 1) Amazon does not offer the same offering or level of service as others, otherwise SHOP CHWY FDX etc would not be as successful as they are despite Amazon trying to enter their businesses. 2) Amazon providing more visibility to telehealth industry could also be a good thing for TDOC

Even if their intention was to not cause their stock to drop because of a massive delay. Perhaps, it would have helped to ease the decline by being more forthcoming. It still would have dropped to about 15-20 which I believe is reasonable trades on an EV company with potential product launches in the next year or less. Wasn't that long ago either.

Basically after I identify a recent pattern I wait for the confirmation that the price will continue that pattern, such as the price breaking through one of the simple moving averages. My stop loss will be a little below the line and my exit spot is a little below the recent swing high.

Its actually really simple. And I hope it keeps working out for me. I trade with not very much money and plan on slowly putting more in if I continue to be profitable for another month or so. I want it to be as stress free as possible lol no wall street bets stuff

To the dick sucking crackwhore who said they have 0 sales and an EPS of 0 but a market cap of 3.3B. Do know what the fuck EV is? As in, Enterprise value? Probably not cause you're a dipshit who read some Investopedia and thinks they are now Bill Ackman. 

Ride is trading with a market cap equivalent to their EV value. Obviously people here in this thread have no fucking clue who Marcus Lemonis is or how much experience he has investing in and running businesses. 

But the dipshit retards who found the stockmarket subreddit after losing all their money YOLOing options on WSB, think they can talk about authorized shares and dilution caused by lock-up period expirations with no real fucking idea what they're talking about probably knows more than Marcus. 

You know, the guy who recently went to the Lordstown factory in Ohio and did his due diligence boots on the ground and actually met with the people on the Lordstown team. Afterwards, he announced his partnership with Camping World. A business which he owns, and turned around himself. So it makes sense for someone who has decades of experience doing just this is probably wrong and the fucking losers on this thread who found Seeking Alpha a week ago and still don't know what Alpha is, they probably know more.

Guess what? Investors who fund start ups, invest in a company with no revenue sometimes, if you can't figure out why, wipe the drool off with your bib, and get this, because that's where the risk is, but that's also how you get the massive returns on capital. So you find a company like Lordstown. Strong team, real estate to manufacture, executives with experience, objective third-party investors and advisors, partnerships, etc

Not all companies can be valued by the same metrics. Some companies are st different stages then others. 

Ride is a company with a real product that works and runs, and it doesn't need the power of a gravity engine to roll downhill like a Nikola. They already own a massive plant to roll right into manufacturing.  The same individual who helped Tesla re-tool their plant for production is the same person who joined Lordstown a few months back.

They already own a massive plant to roll right into manufacturing.  The same individual who helped Tesla re-tool their plant for production is the same person who joined Lordstown a few months back. 

Some of y'all are a bunch of braindead chickenheads who can't make a real fucking return to save their life and its because of the blatantly obvious inability to have any idea in regards to what they are actually trying to talk about.",/r/StockMarket/comments/kofghk/lordstown_motors_gets_new_order_for_14000_pickups/ghs9e19/

Second, find a website you like and get up to speed on terms, and the basics of reading a company financial reports. If you took any accounting in high school or college you'll be up to speed very quickly. I will hit up Investopedia from time to time.

Next, I suggest picking a brokerage website and opening an account. I have one at TD Ameritrade and I love the website and the layout of the research tools. I was able to open it for free, then link a bank account, and I slowly added a few bucks every payday while I used the tools and researched many companies and mutual funds.

If you have a 401k at work, see if the finance company has other services. At a previous employer our 401k and employee stock program were hosted by Fidelity, which automatically opened a brokerage account for me. I really like the research tools that Fidelity provides free of charge. I still have that account and its active with stocks and a mutual fund.

Oh, another reason I like these two firms is importing tax info into TurboTax is a breeze. Like everything else in life, Uncle Sam has to get his cut.

Also, when I started I went with the advice ""Buy what you know"" Coke, Kellogg, OneOK, and then one day while watching my kids having a snack, they were dipping carrot sticks and cheese into ranch dressing. It occured to me everyone likes Hidden Valley Ranch, right? So I set out to research the conpany and low and behold, who owns Hidden Valley Ranch? The Clorox corporation does! I bought into Clorox 10 or 12 years ago at half what it trades now!

I hope you find investing as rewarding as I have over the years. Iam new to the subreddit, but so far I haven't seen anything from anyone that I felt was inappropriate or would lead others the wrong way.
